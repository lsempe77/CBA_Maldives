## C4 (addendum) — Cable Landing Infrastructure Cost

### Recommendation

**Use $30–60M per landing (×2 = $60–120M total). Coral reef barrier at Malé end likely pushes toward upper range.**

### Components of a cable landing

| Component | Description | Typical cost contribution |
|---|---|---|
| Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) | Bore beneath beach/reef to ~20m water depth; avoids surface disruption. Typical crossing length 500–1,700m. | $5–15M per end |
| Transition joint bay (TJB) | Where submarine cable transitions to land cable; includes jointing pit, surge arresters, cable protection | $2–5M per end |
| Cable protection mattresses & rock armour | Concrete mattresses or rock dumping over cable in shallow water / reef crossing zone | $3–8M per end |
| Beach manhole (BMH) | Reinforced underground chamber at shoreline where cable comes ashore | $0.5–2M per end |
| Shore-end cable (double-armoured) | Heavier-duty cable for shallow water / surf zone, typically 1–5 km | $3–10M per end (cable + installation) |
| Access road, environmental mitigation | Reef crossing permits, marine habitat offsets, construction access | $2–10M per end |
| Cable landing station (CLS) | Building housing protection equipment, monitoring, fibre optic termination | $3–8M per end |

- **Key detail:** The Basslink route includes transition stations at both shore crossings (McGauran Beach, Victoria; Low Head, Tasmania) where submarine cable transitions to underground DC cable. These transition stations include cable jointing facilities, surge protection, and monitoring equipment.
- **Estimated landing cost per end:** ~A$25M (based on underground cable sections + transition station costs from the Amplitude report).

#### GridLink Interconnector (UK–France, 140 km, under development)

- **URL:** https://gridlinkinterconnector.com/project-information/design-of-the-converter-stations-and-cables/subsea-and-onshore-hvdc-cable-design/
- **Key detail:** HDD at both shore crossings (Kingsnorth UK, Dunkerque France). Drilling passes ~10m below ground surface. In the UK, the subsea cable crosses the coastline by HDD and emerges directly at the converter station site — no underground cable required.
- **Relevance:** Demonstrates that HDD-direct-to-converter is possible where site conditions permit, reducing landing costs.

#### Zhoushan Islands HDD study (China, 2025)

- **Citation:** "A Numerical Study on the Pullback Process of a Submarine Cable Based on Trenchless Directional Drilling Technology." *Water* 2025, 17(10), 1517. https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/17/10/1517
- **Key finding:** For the Zhoushan islands context, maximum HDD crossing length is 1,700m and maximum incident angle is 35°. Crossing length and incident angle significantly affect cable tension during pullback.
- **Relevance for Maldives:** Coral substrate may limit HDD viability; alternative approaches (open-cut trench with reef rehabilitation) may be needed at Malé landing.

### Maldives-specific considerations

- **Coral reef barrier:** Malé is surrounded by a continuous reef flat. Any submarine cable landing must cross this reef, adding environmental mitigation costs (reef transplantation, monitoring) and engineering complexity (may require open-cut trench rather than HDD through coral limestone).
- **India-side landing:** The cable's India endpoint (likely southern Tamil Nadu or Kerala coast) has conventional sandy/rocky shoreline — standard HDD feasible.
- **Precedent:** The Dhiraagu submarine fibre-optic cable system connects the Maldives to Sri Lanka and India. Cable landing at Hulhumalé. While fibre-optic cables are much smaller than power cables, the route survey and environmental permitting process provides a local precedent.

### Shore-end installation services

- **A-2-Sea Solutions:** Specialist in submarine cable shore-end installations; has installed >100 shore ends globally. Services include HDD, beach jointing, armour wire anchoring, cable protection. https://www.a2sea.co.uk/services/shore-end-cable-installation/
- **NKT Offshore Installation:** Purpose-built equipment for cable laying, jointing, and pull-in to shore. Burial methods include ploughing, jetting, and mechanical trenching. https://www.nkt.com/products-solutions/high-voltage-cable-solutions/installation/offshore-installation

### Suggested parameter

| Parameter | Value | Range | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing infrastructure per end | $40M | $25–60M | NorNed ~€15M (simple), Basslink ~A$25M; Maldives coral reef adds 50–100% |
| Total (2 landings) | $80M | $50–120M | Derived |

### Suggested caveat text

> "Cable landing infrastructure estimated at $40M per end based on NorNed (€15M/end, 2008) and Basslink (A$25M/end, 2023) comparables, with a 50–100% uplift for Maldives coral reef crossing, environmental mitigation, and island logistics. No Maldives-specific power cable landing study exists; the closest local precedent is the Dhiraagu fibre-optic submarine cable system."

## C4 (addendum) — Interest During Construction (IDC)

### Recommendation

**Use IDC rate of 15% of overnight CAPEX (range 10–20%). Apply as: Total project cost = Overnight CAPEX × (1 + IDC rate).**

### What IDC is

Interest During Construction is the interest cost accrued on borrowed funds during a project's construction phase before it generates revenue. In project finance, IDC is typically capitalised (added to the project's total cost) rather than expensed. For large infrastructure projects with 3–5 year construction periods, IDC can add 10–20% to the overnight capital cost.

### Key determinants

| Factor | Maldives HVDC Cable Context | Impact on IDC |
|---|---|---|
| Construction period | 3–4 years (submarine cable fabrication + laying + converter station construction) | Longer → Higher IDC |
| Debt drawdown profile | Progressive, with heaviest drawdown in years 2–3 | Front-loaded → Higher IDC |
| Interest rate | 5–7% for MDB concessional blends; 8–12% for commercial | Higher rate → Higher IDC |
| Debt share of financing | 60–80% typical for infrastructure | Higher leverage → Higher IDC |

### Sources and methodology

#### Financial Edge — IDC Primer

- **URL:** https://www.fe.training/free-resources/project-finance/interest-during-construction-idc/
- **Key points:** IDC compounds over the construction period; for a 3-year construction with 6% interest rate and progressive drawdown, IDC typically adds 12–18% to overnight CAPEX. "Every time interest is added to the debt balance that debt balance and the interest charged will grow."

#### Medium — IDC in Project Finance (Bernath, 2024)

- **Citation:** Bernath, M. (2024). "Modelling Interest During Construction (IDC) in Project Finance." *Medium*.
- **URL:** https://medium.com/@matthew.bernath/modelling-interest-during-construction-idc-in-project-finance-56162227df66
- **Key finding:** "IDC can significantly increase the total project cost, sometimes by 10–15% or more, depending on the project's size, duration, and interest rate."

#### BlueGamma — IDC Calculation Guide

- **URL:** https://www.bluegamma.io/post/interest-during-construction-idc-in-project-finance
- **Key detail:** IDC calculation requires forward-looking interest rate curves (SOFR, EURIBOR, etc.). For stress testing, model base, high, and low scenarios.

#### ADB — Cost Estimation Technical Guidance

- **Source:** ADB (2014). Financial Management Technical Guidance Note: Preparing and Presenting Cost Estimates.
- **URL:** https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/34142/files/fmtgn-preparing-presenting-cost-estimates.pdf
- **Key details:** ADB standard practice includes IDC in project cost estimates. "Financial charges during implementation: Calculated on the basis of interest and other financing charges applicable on ADB and other project-related debt." ADB loans with >13 year average maturity attract maturity premiums of 10–20 basis points. Table 2 in the document provides an IDC calculation example.
- **ADB Operations Manual reference:** OM H1/BP — "Financing of Interest and Other Charges During Construction."

#### Chandoo — IDC Excel Modelling Tutorial

- **URL:** https://chandoo.org/wp/modeling-interest-during-construction/
- **Key insight:** IDC introduces circular references in financial models (debt balance depends on IDC which depends on debt balance). Requires iterative calculation or VBA macro to resolve.

### Simplified IDC calculation for the Maldives cable

Assumptions: $2.5B overnight CAPEX, 70% debt financed, 6% interest rate, 3-year construction, linear drawdown.

| Year | Cumulative Draw ($B) | Interest Accrued ($M) |
|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | 0.58 | 35 |
| Year 2 | 1.17 | 70 + compound on Y1 |
| Year 3 | 1.75 | 105 + compound on Y1+Y2 |
| **Total IDC** | | **~$250–375M** |
| **As % of overnight CAPEX** | | **~10–15%** |

At higher commercial rates (8–10%) or longer construction (4 years), IDC rises to 15–20%.

### Suggested parameter

| Parameter | Central | Range | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| IDC rate (% of overnight CAPEX) | 0.15 | 0.10–0.20 | Standard project finance (ADB, World Bank appraisals) |

## C4 (addendum) — Malé Grid Upgrade

### Recommendation

**Use $50–100M as a placeholder. Flag as "no public data; comparator-based estimate."**

### Evidence

- **India–Sri Lanka HVDC feasibility study (JICA/ADB):** Included $50–100M grid reinforcement on the Sri Lanka side to absorb 500MW of imported power. Source: Referenced in CEB LTGEP documents; JICA study itself not publicly available.
- **Maldives Energy Roadmap 2024–2033:** Notes that STELCO genset dispatch is currently done with "old fashioned manual controls" and the distribution grid needs upgrading. https://www.environment.gov.mv/v2/wp-content/files/publications/20241107-pub-energy-roadmap-maldives-2024-2033-.pdf
- **STELCO Master Plan (draft):** Projects 9.6% demand growth rate for Greater Malé to 2040. This implies substantial grid investment even without the India cable.
- **ARISE/POISED grid modernisation:** The World Bank ARISE project includes $20M AIIB co-financing for Component 3 (grid modernisation). The ADB POISED project includes SCADA systems, energy management systems, and distribution network upgrades. https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/554641608001729081/pdf/Maldives-Accelerating-Renewable-Energy-Integration-and-Sustainable-Energy-Project.pdf
- **Relevance:** Even partial grid costs from ARISE/POISED provide a lower bound for the grid investment needed to absorb 200MW from an HVDC cable.

## M1 — Island-Level Demand Allocation (Intensity Multipliers)

### Recommendation

**Derive 3 multipliers from the 2018 Island Electricity Data Book: Urban ×1.8, Secondary ×1.2, Rural ×0.6. Calibrate to reproduce the 57% Malé share.**

### Key data source

- **Island Electricity Data Book 2018:** Per-island installed capacity, generation (kWh), fuel consumption, peak demand, load factor for 115 inhabited islands. Published by Ministry of Environment and Energy.
- **PDF:** https://www.environment.gov.mv/v2/wp-content/files/publications/20181105-pub-island-electricity-data-book-2018.pdf
- **Partially cleaned CSV already exists in the model:** `maldives_island_electricity_2018_clean_corrected.csv`

### Supporting per-capita data

| Location | Per-capita consumption (kWh/yr) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Greater Malé Region (2012) | ~2,730 | UN Energy Statistics 2016 presentation |
| Other Atolls (2012) | ~1,060 | UN Energy Statistics 2016 presentation |
| National average (2017) | ~1,900 | Derived: 704 GWh ÷ 370,000 pop |

- **UN Energy Statistics:** https://unstats.un.org/unsd/energy/meetings/2016iwc/25maldives.pdf
- **Per-capita ratio:** Greater Malé / Other Atolls ≈ 2.6:1 in 2012. This ratio has likely narrowed slightly as outer islands gain air conditioning.

### Proposed multiplier structure

| Island class | Population range | Multiplier | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greater Malé (Malé, Hulhumalé, Villimalé) | >15,000 | ×1.8 | Dense urban, commercial, government, heavy AC load |
| Secondary urban (Addu, Kulhudhuffushi, Fuvahmulah, Thinadhoo, etc.) | 3,000–15,000 | ×1.2 | Semi-urban, some commercial activity |
| Outer rural islands | <3,000 | ×0.6 | Residential, limited commercial, lower AC penetration |

### Validation target

The multipliers should reproduce:
- Greater Malé = ~57% of national inhabited-island generation (confirmed by Island Electricity Data Books 2016–2018)
- Total national generation = ~1,200 GWh (2024 estimate)

## L6 — Tourism Demand Module

### Recommendation

**Include as sensitivity scenario. Central estimate: 1,050 GWh/yr resort electricity. Green premium WTP: $0.05–0.10/kWh.**

### Resort electricity demand

#### Bottom-up estimate

- **Key finding:** Positive correlation between guest satisfaction and WTP premium for green hotels. Green experiential loyalty has moderating effect.

### Converting WTP to $/kWh green premium

| Approach | Calculation | $/kWh premium |
|---|---|---|
| 5% room rate premium → energy cost | Avg. Maldives resort room: ~$500/night; 5% = $25/night; energy cost ~20–30% of operating cost; 1 room ≈ 50 kWh/night → $25 ÷ 50 = | ~$0.50/kWh (theoretical max) |
| Direct energy cost premium | Resort LCOE diesel: $0.30–0.70; green renewable: $0.15–0.25; difference already favourable | $0.00 (renewables already cheaper) |
| Voluntary green energy surcharge | Based on literature: 5–15% premium on electricity bill | $0.02–0.07/kWh |
| **Recommended range** | Conservative estimate for CBA modelling | **$0.05–0.10/kWh** |

### Suggested caveat text

> "Resort tourism electricity demand estimated at 1,050 GWh/yr from ~160 self-contained resort islands (bottom-up: 160 × 1.5 MW × 0.5 load factor × 8,760 hrs). A green energy premium of $0.05–0.10/kWh is applied based on Damigos (2023) systematic review finding of ~5% WTP premium and Riyaz (2024) Maldives-specific eco-resort profitability evidence. This module is treated as a sensitivity scenario; the base CBA covers only the public utility system."

## L11 — Connection Cost Per Household

### Recommendation

**Use $200/HH (range $150–300/HH). Flag as "GEP-OnSSET standard with island logistics uplift."**

### GEP-OnSSET framework

- **Source:** Global Electrification Platform (GEP), World Bank ESMAP. https://www.esmap.org/global-electrification-platform-gep
- **OnSSET documentation:** https://onsset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/global-electrification-platform/gep-onsset
- **Standard assumption:** GEP-OnSSET includes a per-household grid connection cost of $100–200/HH for developing countries. This covers the "last mile" from distribution transformer to household: service cable, meter, internal wiring check, and connection labour.

#### Sub-Saharan Africa OnSSET study

- **Citation:** "The cost of electrifying all households in 40 Sub-Saharan African countries by 2030." *Nature Communications* (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40612-3
- **PMC:** https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10442407/
- **Key detail:** Uses OnSSET v.1.0 from GEP with techno-economic variables including technology costs and realistic financing conditions. Grid extension option includes connection costs per household.

### STELCO/FENAKA connection process (Maldives)

- **STELCO Services page:** https://stelco.com.mv/services
  - New connections require: application form, panel drawings and load calculations approved by Maldives Energy Authority, meter tested by STELCO, site survey.
  - Customer must provide their own meter (purchased from authorised suppliers). STELCO connects after payment and survey approval.
  - No published connection fee schedule found on the website.

- **FENAKA Corporation:** https://fenaka.mv/
  - Operates in 157 inhabited islands. No published fee schedule found.

### Cost components for island connection

| Component | Estimated cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Meter (single-phase, prepaid) | $30–80 | Widely available; smart meters at higher end |
| Service cable (from pole/transformer to house) | $20–50 | 15–50m typical; includes fittings |
| Internal wiring check / upgrade | $30–80 | Basic safety inspection + minor remediation |
| Installation labour | $30–60 | Higher on remote islands due to logistics |
| Administrative / connection fee | $10–30 | MEA approval, documentation |
| **Total per household** | **$120–300** | |

### Island logistics premium

On outer islands, all materials must arrive by boat. Technicians may need to travel from the regional hub. This adds 30–50% to mainland connection costs. For very remote atolls, mobilisation/demobilisation costs can exceed the connection cost itself for small batches.

### Total system impact

| Scenario | # Households | Cost/HH | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| All 176 inhabited islands | ~100,000 | $200 | $20M |
| Only newly connected islands (excl. already-gridded) | ~30,000 | $250 | $7.5M |

Small relative to $2B+ cable cost, but relevant for per-island cost-effectiveness in `grid_vs_standalone.py`.

## H4 — Inter-Island AC Cable Losses

### Recommendation

**Use 3% transit loss for inter-island AC cables (range 2–5%). Distinct from the 11% distribution loss (which includes transformer + LV network losses).**

### Why this matters

The model currently applies 11% distribution loss (World Bank WDI) uniformly. But for islands connected via short submarine AC cables (Tranches T1–T3, 5–50 km), the cable transit loss is a separate component. The 11% figure includes transformer stepping losses, LV network losses, and non-technical losses — most of which occur *after* the AC cable delivers power to the island.

### Cable loss physics

For submarine AC cables, losses comprise:
1. **Resistive (I²R) losses:** Proportional to current squared and cable length. For XLPE cables at moderate loading, typically 1–3% per 50 km.
2. **Dielectric losses:** Negligible for XLPE at voltages below 132 kV.
3. **Sheath and armour losses:** Induced currents in metallic sheath and steel wire armour. IEC 60287-1-1 provides calculation methods, but IEC standards are known to overestimate armour losses in SL-type cables.
4. **Charging current (reactive power):** AC cables have significant capacitance. Charging current consumes part of the cable's current-carrying capacity, reducing real power transfer. For 33 kV three-core XLPE submarine cable: ~100 A/km charging current. For 132 kV: ~30–50 A/km.

#### Cable loss rules of thumb

| Cable type | Voltage | Length | Typical losses | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 33 kV three-core XLPE submarine | 33 kV | 10 km | 1–2% at rated load | CIGRÉ TB 610 / IEC 60287 |
| 33 kV three-core XLPE submarine | 33 kV | 50 km | 3–6% at rated load | CIGRÉ TB 610 / engineering estimate |
| 132 kV three-core XLPE submarine | 132 kV | 50 km | 2–4% at rated load | CIGRÉ TB 610 / IEC 60287 |
| HVAC submarine limit | Any | ~80–100 km | Reactive compensation needed | CIGRÉ / ESCAEU |

- **ESCAEU (European Subsea Cables Association):** "Interconnectors using HVAC cables are currently limited to lengths of approx. 100 km." "The majority of these distribution or transmission subsea circuits are AC cables at medium or high voltages of up to 132kV. Electricity connections to many islands rely on single radial circuits and often replace old islanded diesel generation." https://www.escaeu.org/articles/submarine-power-cables/

### Suggested parameter

| Parameter | Value | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Inter-island AC cable transit loss | 3% | 2–5% | For 5–50 km, 33–132 kV XLPE submarine cables |

**Implementation note:** This 3% should be applied *in addition to* the island-level distribution loss. The current 11% WDI figure should be decomposed as:
- AC cable transit loss: 3% (new parameter)
- Island distribution loss: 8% (adjusted from 11%)
- Total: 11% (unchanged at system level)

This decomposition matters only for the grid-vs-standalone comparison, where a standalone island avoids the cable transit loss but still has local distribution losses.

## H5 (addendum) — Per-Island Electricity Data Digitisation

### Status

Data exists in cleaned CSV form (`maldives_island_electricity_2018_clean_corrected.csv`) covering 115 of 176 inhabited islands. These 115 islands represent ~95% of inhabited-island electricity generation.

### What remains

1. **Name matching:** Island names in the Data Book use Dhivehi transliterations that may not match `islands_master.csv` (which uses Census 2022 names). Need fuzzy matching or manual crosswalk.
2. **Gap-filling:** The 61 islands not in the Data Book are very small (<200 population). Estimate their consumption from population × rural per-capita rate (~700 kWh/capita/yr).
3. **Validation checks:**
   - National total should sum to ~704 GWh (2017 Data Book figure)
   - Greater Malé share should be ~57%
   - National average load factor should be ~0.68
   - National average fuel efficiency should be ~3.31 kWh/L

### No additional external data needed — this is a data wrangling task using existing files.

## H9 (addendum) — Climate Adaptation CAPEX Premium (Additional Sources)

### ADB/World Bank Maldives energy projects with adaptation components

#### POISED Project (ADB)

- **Source:** ADB Project 46122-005. https://www.adb.org/projects/46122-005/main
- **Key detail:** Additional financing includes "development of a climate- and disaster-resilient distribution system in identified outer islands." The project installs cyclone-rated solar mounting structures, BESS with environmental protection, and resilient distribution grids.
- **Total project:** ~$129M in concessional grants and loans. Source: CIF case study. https://www.cif.org/news/maldives-poised-road-renewables
- **Limitation:** No itemised breakdown of climate adaptation costs as a % of total CAPEX.

#### ASPIRE/ARISE Projects (World Bank)

- **Source:** World Bank (2021). "The ASPIRE Project: De-risking solar projects to catalyze private investment in the Maldives." https://www.worldbank.org/en/results/2021/03/31/derisking-solar-projects-to-catalyze-private-investment-in-maldives
- **ARISE PAD:** https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/554641608001729081/pdf/Maldives-Accelerating-Renewable-Energy-Integration-and-Sustainable-Energy-Project.pdf
- **Key detail:** ARISE includes $107.4M total, with components for "improved power system capacity for increased renewable energy penetration" and grid modernisation. Climate resilience is embedded in design specifications rather than costed separately.

#### ADB ASSURE Project

- **Source:** ADB Project 55191-001. https://www.adb.org/projects/55191-001/main
- **Key detail:** Includes "disaster-resilient, innovative, and gender- and socially inclusive renewable energy-based farming technologies." Wind-solar hybrid systems and ocean energy pilots with climate resilience requirements.

#### GCF Maldives projects

- **Source:** Green Climate Fund country page. https://www.greenclimate.fund/countries/maldives
- **Key projects:** GCF-funded adaptation project via UNDP (2017). Earlier projects focused on water security and coastal adaptation rather than energy infrastructure specifically.

### Climate risk context

- **ADB POISED documentation:** "Maldives consistently faces risk of small-scale and recurrent hazards, such as excessive precipitation, cyclonic winds, storm surges, saltwater intrusion, and coastal flooding. It is estimated that Maldives may face an annual loss of up to 2.3% of GDP by 2050 because of the impacts of climate change."
- **Generation cost:** $0.30–0.70/kWh on outer islands (ADB estimate). Source: https://www.adb.org/projects/46122-005/main

### Bottom line

No Maldives-specific energy infrastructure adaptation cost premium has been published as a standalone percentage. The 7.5% (range 5–10%) used in the model is consistent with:
- GCA (2025) BCR of 6.5:1 for Maldives adaptation (economy-wide)
- Standard MDB practice of embedding climate resilience in design specifications
- Engineering estimates: cyclone-rated solar racking (+3–5% PV CAPEX), elevated battery containers (+5–10% BESS CAPEX), reef crossing cable protection (+5–15% cable CAPEX)
