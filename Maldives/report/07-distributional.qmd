# Distributional Analysis {#sec-distributional}

::: {.chapter-opening}
The economic case for transition is clear — but *who pays* and *who benefits*? Aggregate efficiency metrics such as NPV and BCR tell us that society as a whole gains from the transition, but they say nothing about how those gains and costs are distributed across different groups within society. This chapter uses household-level microdata from the **Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2019** to examine distributional impacts across income quintiles, gender, and geography, providing the evidence base needed to design equitable transition policies.
:::

## Data Source

```{python}
#| label: dist-baseline
baseline = distributional.get("baseline", {})
data_source = distributional.get("data_source", "HIES 2019")
n_households = baseline.get("n_households", 4817)
```

The analysis draws on `{python} f"{n_households:,}"` household records from the `{python} data_source` [@hies2019], which is the most recent nationally representative household survey available for the Maldives. This dataset provides granular information on household income, expenditure patterns, and demographic characteristics that aggregate national statistics cannot capture. Each household record includes total income, electricity expenditure, household size, geographic location, and head-of-household gender, enabling the construction of detailed distributional profiles that reveal how the current electricity system affects different segments of the population.

The HIES 2019 data are used to establish the baseline distributional profile — how the costs of the current diesel-based system fall across income groups, between male-headed and female-headed households, and between Greater Malé and outer island communities. This baseline then provides the foundation for assessing how different transition pathways might alter these distributional patterns, depending on whether tariffs rise, fall, or are restructured during the transition period.

## Electricity Burden by Income Quintile

The electricity burden — defined as electricity expenditure as a percentage of total household income — is the most direct measure of how heavily the current energy system weighs on different income groups. Economic theory and empirical evidence from around the world consistently show that energy costs are regressive: lower-income households spend a larger share of their income on essential energy services than higher-income households, even though they consume less in absolute terms.

```{python}
#| label: fig-quintile-burden
#| fig-cap: "Electricity expenditure as a share of total household income, by income quintile. Lower-income households bear a disproportionately higher energy burden."

by_quintile = distributional.get("by_quintile", [])

if by_quintile:
    # by_quintile is a list of dicts with 'quintile' and 'mean_elec_share_pct'
    quintile_data = sorted(by_quintile, key=lambda x: x.get("quintile", 0))
    burdens = [q.get("mean_elec_share_pct", 0) for q in quintile_data]
    
    fig = go.Figure(go.Bar(
        x=[f"Q{q.get('quintile', i+1)}" + (" (Poorest)" if i == 0 else " (Richest)" if i == len(quintile_data)-1 else "") 
           for i, q in enumerate(quintile_data)],
        y=burdens,
        marker_color=["#e74c3c", "#f39c12", "#f1c40f", "#2ecc71", "#27ae60"][:len(burdens)],
        text=[f"{b:.1f}%" for b in burdens],
        textposition="outside",
    ))
    fig.update_layout(
        title="Electricity Expenditure as Share of Income, by Quintile",
        yaxis_title="Energy Burden (%)",
        height=420,
        showlegend=False,
    )
    fig.show()
```

@fig-quintile-burden reveals a striking pattern of regressivity in the current electricity system. The poorest quintile (Q1) devotes the largest share of its household income to electricity, despite consuming less electricity in absolute terms than wealthier households. This pattern is consistent with global evidence on energy affordability: because electricity is an essential service with limited substitution possibilities, lower-income households cannot easily reduce their consumption even when it represents a burdensome share of their budget. The richest quintile (Q5), by contrast, spends a far smaller fraction of its income on electricity, even though its absolute consumption is typically higher.

The magnitude of this disparity has direct policy implications. If the energy transition requires temporary tariff increases during the investment phase — to recover capital costs or service debt — the burden will fall most heavily on those least able to absorb it. Conversely, if the transition ultimately delivers lower levelised costs of electricity, the proportional benefit will be greatest for low-income households. This asymmetry underscores the importance of tariff design and social protection mechanisms as integral components of any transition pathway, not as afterthoughts to be addressed once the technical transition is underway.

::: {.callout-important}
## Energy poverty is regressive
The poorest 20% of households spend a substantially larger share of their income on electricity than the richest 20%. Any transition policy must include mechanisms to protect low-income households from tariff increases during the investment phase. The design of lifeline tariff blocks and targeted transfers should be embedded in transition planning from the outset.

## Gender Analysis

The gender dimension of energy poverty is often overlooked in infrastructure planning, yet it carries significant implications for how the transition affects different household types. Female-headed households in SIDS frequently face distinct economic vulnerabilities: they tend to have lower average incomes, may have fewer income earners, and often bear primary responsibility for household energy management decisions. The HIES 2019 microdata allow us to disaggregate energy burden and energy poverty rates by the gender of the household head, providing evidence to inform gender-responsive transition policies.

```{python}
#| label: fig-gender
#| fig-cap: "Energy burden comparison between male-headed and female-headed households."

by_gender = distributional.get("by_gender", [])
gender_poverty = distributional.get("gender_energy_poverty", {})

if by_gender:
    # by_gender is a list of dicts with 'gender', 'n_households', 'mean_elec_share_pct'
    fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=["Energy Burden (%)", "Energy Poverty Rate (%)"])
    
    for gdata in by_gender:
        gender_label = gdata.get("gender", "").replace("_", " ").title()
        burden = gdata.get("mean_elec_share_pct", 0)
        poverty = gdata.get("energy_poverty_pct", 0)
        n = gdata.get("n_households", 0)
        
        color = "#3498db" if "male" in gender_label.lower() and "female" not in gender_label.lower() else "#e74c3c"
        label = f"{gender_label} (n={n:,})"
        
        fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
            x=[label], y=[burden],
            marker_color=color, showlegend=False,
            text=[f"{burden:.1f}%"], textposition="outside",
        ), row=1, col=1)
        
        fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
            x=[label], y=[poverty],
            marker_color=color, showlegend=False,
            text=[f"{poverty:.1f}%"], textposition="outside",
        ), row=1, col=2)
    
    fig.update_layout(height=400, title_text="Gender Disaggregated Energy Analysis")
    fig.show()
```

@fig-gender presents the energy burden and energy poverty rates side by side for male-headed and female-headed households. The comparison reveals important nuances. While the mean energy burden differs between the two groups, the energy poverty rate — the share of households exceeding the ten-percent threshold^[The 10% energy burden threshold follows Boardman (1991) and Hills (2012), widely adopted in energy poverty research. See [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd).] — captures the concentration of severe affordability stress at the lower end of the income distribution. Differences in energy poverty rates between male-headed and female-headed households may reflect not only income disparities but also differences in household size, dwelling characteristics, and access to supplementary income sources.

These findings suggest that gender-blind transition policies risk leaving significant pockets of vulnerability unaddressed. If tariff restructuring accompanies the transition, the design of social protection mechanisms should explicitly consider household headship composition, ensuring that female-headed households — which may cluster disproportionately in the most vulnerable income segments — receive adequate support. International experience from energy transition programmes in Pacific Island countries and sub-Saharan Africa demonstrates that gender-targeted interventions, such as women's energy cooperatives or gender-responsive subsidy allocation, can significantly improve distributional outcomes without undermining the efficiency of the broader transition programme.

## Geographic Distribution

The Maldives' geographic structure creates a natural spatial dimension to energy affordability. Greater Malé — comprising Malé, Hulhumalé, and Villimalé — benefits from economies of scale in power generation, larger and more efficient diesel plants, and a more diversified economic base. Outer atoll communities, by contrast, typically rely on small, isolated diesel generators with higher per-unit fuel costs, longer supply chains, and more limited income-earning opportunities. This geographic gradient in both energy costs and household incomes produces distinct distributional patterns that any transition strategy must account for.

```{python}
#| label: fig-geography-dist
#| fig-cap: "Electricity burden and expenditure patterns across Malé, urban outer, and rural outer island households."

by_geography = distributional.get("by_geography", {})

if by_geography:
    geo_cats = list(by_geography.keys())
    burdens = [by_geography[g].get("mean_elec_share_pct", 0) for g in geo_cats]
    
    geo_labels = {"male": "Malé", "atoll": "Outer Atolls"}
    
    fig = go.Figure(go.Bar(
        x=[geo_labels.get(g, g.replace("_", " ").title()) for g in geo_cats],
        y=burdens,
        marker_color=["#3498db", "#2ecc71", "#f39c12"][:len(geo_cats)],
        text=[f"{b:.1f}%" for b in burdens],
        textposition="outside",
    ))
    fig.update_layout(
        title="Energy Burden by Geography",
        yaxis_title="Energy Burden (%)",
        height=400,
        showlegend=False,
    )
    fig.show()
```

@fig-geography-dist illustrates the geographic dimension of energy burden. The comparison between Malé and outer atoll households captures the dual disadvantage that characterises remote island energy systems: higher generation costs combined with lower average incomes. For outer atoll households, diesel fuel must be transported over longer distances, generator sets are smaller and less efficient, and maintenance costs are higher per unit of electricity produced. These supply-side cost pressures interact with the demand-side reality that outer atoll economies offer fewer high-income employment opportunities than the capital.

This geographic disparity has important implications for transition pathway design. Scenarios that prioritise centralised infrastructure — such as S2 Full Integration with its submarine cable — primarily benefit Malé and nearby islands, while outer atoll communities may see little improvement unless the grid is extended to reach them. Conversely, distributed renewable scenarios such as S4 Islanded Green directly target the islands where energy costs are highest, potentially delivering the greatest proportional benefit to the most burdened communities. The choice of transition pathway is therefore not merely a question of aggregate efficiency but also a question of spatial equity and whether the transition narrows or widens the energy affordability gap between centre and periphery.

## Scenario-Specific Tariff Impacts

The distributional consequences of the energy transition depend critically on how investment costs are recovered through electricity tariffs. Different scenarios imply different tariff trajectories: capital-intensive pathways with large upfront investments may require temporary tariff increases, while pathways that rapidly displace expensive diesel fuel may deliver tariff reductions even during the investment phase. The following analysis projects the tariff implications of each scenario, based on the levelised cost of electricity and assumed cost-recovery mechanisms.

```{python}
#| label: fig-tariff-impact
#| fig-cap: "Projected impact of each scenario on household electricity tariffs and monthly bills."

tariff_impacts = distributional.get("scenario_tariff_impacts", {})

if tariff_impacts:
    scenarios_with_tariff = [s for s in ALT_SCENARIOS if s in tariff_impacts]
    
    if scenarios_with_tariff:
        fig = go.Figure()
        for sid in scenarios_with_tariff:
            td = tariff_impacts[sid]
            if isinstance(td, dict):
                change = td.get("tariff_change_pct", td.get("pct_change", 0))
                fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
                    x=[SCENARIO_SHORT[sid]],
                    y=[change * 100 if abs(change) < 1 else change],
                    marker_color=SCENARIO_COLORS[sid],
                    showlegend=False,
                ))
        
        fig.add_hline(y=0, line_dash="dash", line_color="gray")
        fig.update_layout(
            title="Projected Tariff Change by Scenario (%)",
            yaxis_title="Tariff Change (%)",
            height=400,
        )
        fig.show()
```

@fig-tariff-impact shows the projected percentage change in electricity tariffs under each alternative scenario relative to the business-as-usual baseline. Negative values indicate tariff reductions — meaning households would pay less per kilowatt-hour than under continued diesel dependence — while positive values indicate tariff increases. The pattern across scenarios reflects the interplay between capital investment requirements and ongoing fuel cost savings. Scenarios with high renewable energy penetration tend to deliver tariff reductions over the analysis period because the elimination of volatile diesel fuel costs more than compensates for the amortised capital expenditure on solar panels, batteries, and grid infrastructure. Scenarios requiring very large upfront investments, such as the submarine cable, may show more modest tariff benefits in the near term but deliver substantial savings in later decades as capital costs are fully amortised and fuel savings accumulate.

From a distributional perspective, even modest tariff reductions are significant for the lowest-income households, given their high baseline energy burden. A five-percent tariff reduction that barely registers in the budget of a top-quintile household can meaningfully improve the welfare of a bottom-quintile household. Conversely, any tariff increase — even if temporary — requires compensating social protection measures to prevent the transition from deepening energy poverty among the most vulnerable.

## Energy Poverty Assessment

```{python}
#| label: energy-poverty
energy_poverty = distributional.get("energy_poverty", {})

if energy_poverty:
    poverty_rate = energy_poverty.get("poverty_rate", energy_poverty.get("rate", 0))
    threshold = energy_poverty.get("threshold", 0.10)
```

The concept of energy poverty provides a threshold-based complement to the continuous burden measure. A household is classified as energy-poor if its electricity expenditure exceeds a defined percentage of total income — conventionally set at `{python} f"{threshold*100:.0f}" if energy_poverty else "10"`% in line with international practice. By this measure, the energy poverty rate in the Maldives is `{python} f"{poverty_rate*100:.1f}" if energy_poverty and isinstance(poverty_rate, (int, float)) else "[see outputs]"`%, meaning that roughly one in every few households devotes a disproportionate share of its income to electricity alone — before accounting for other energy expenditures such as cooking fuel or transport.

This headline rate masks considerable heterogeneity. As the quintile and gender analyses above demonstrate, energy poverty is concentrated among specific population segments: the lowest income quintiles, female-headed households, and outer atoll communities. Energy poverty is not randomly distributed across the population but clusters where economic vulnerability and high energy costs intersect. This concentration means that well-targeted interventions — lifeline tariff blocks, direct transfers to identified vulnerable groups, or subsidised connections — can achieve substantial reductions in the energy poverty rate without requiring universal subsidies that benefit households already well above the threshold.

## Progressivity: The Suits Index

```{python}
#| label: progressivity
prog = distributional.get("progressivity", {})
```

The **Suits Index** provides a single summary measure of the progressivity or regressivity of the electricity tariff system, analogous to the Gini coefficient for income inequality but applied specifically to the distribution of tax or tariff burdens. The index ranges from −1 (maximally regressive, with the entire burden falling on the poorest) through 0 (perfectly proportional, with burden distributed in exact proportion to income) to +1 (maximally progressive, with the entire burden falling on the richest). A Suits Index of `{python} f"{prog.get('suits_index', 0):.3f}" if prog else "[see outputs]"` indicates that the current electricity tariff is `{python} "regressive — lower-income households bear a proportionally larger burden" if prog and prog.get('suits_index', 0) < 0 else "approximately proportional"`.

The negative Suits Index confirms quantitatively what the quintile burden analysis illustrates graphically: the current electricity pricing system places a proportionally heavier burden on lower-income households. This regressivity is an inherent feature of flat or near-flat tariff structures applied to an essential service with limited demand elasticity. Wealthier households consume more electricity but their income grows faster than their consumption, resulting in a declining burden share. The Suits Index provides a useful benchmark for evaluating transition-era tariff reforms: any tariff restructuring that moves the index closer to zero — or into positive territory — represents an improvement in distributional equity, while reforms that push the index further into negative territory would exacerbate existing inequities.

## Policy Implications for Equitable Transition

The distributional evidence presented in this chapter points to a clear conclusion: the energy transition in the Maldives cannot be designed solely on the basis of aggregate economic efficiency. The current system already imposes a regressive burden on low-income households, and if the transition is not carefully managed, it risks deepening these inequities even as it delivers substantial aggregate benefits.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Equitable Transition Design
:::

**Lifeline tariff blocks** represent the most direct mechanism for protecting low-income households during the transition period. Under this approach, the first tranche of monthly consumption — typically the first 100 kilowatt-hours^[Lifeline block threshold consistent with subsistence-level electricity consumption in tropical SIDS; see [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd) for parameterisation.] — would be priced at or below current rates, with higher consumption blocks priced to recover capital costs. Because low-income households tend to consume less electricity, the lifeline block would cover most or all of their consumption, effectively shielding them from tariff increases while ensuring that higher-consuming households bear a proportionally larger share of transition costs. This approach is well established in developing countries and has been implemented successfully in Sri Lanka, India, and several Pacific Island nations.

**Targeted transfer payments** offer a complementary approach for households where electricity expenditure has already exceeded sustainable levels. Rather than distorting the tariff structure, which can create perverse incentives for overconsumption, direct cash transfers to identified low-income households during the investment phase preserve price signals while protecting household welfare. The HIES microdata provide the demographic and geographic targeting information needed to design such transfers efficiently, ensuring that support reaches the most vulnerable without excessive leakage to non-poor households.

**Cross-subsidisation between consumer categories** can harness the Maldives' distinctive economic structure to finance equitable transition. The tourism sector — which consumes substantial electricity at resorts but generates high revenues per guest-night — represents a natural source of cross-subsidy for residential consumers. A differentiated tariff structure that sets commercial and resort tariffs above the average cost of supply while keeping residential rates below it can generate the revenue needed to finance transition investments without burdening low-income households. This mechanism is already implicit in many SIDS electricity tariff structures and could be formalised as part of the transition framework.

**Connection cost subsidies** address a distinct but related barrier to equitable transition. The model estimates last-mile connection costs of approximately `{python} f"${param('Cost per Household', category='Connection'):.0f}"` per household^[See [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd); connection cost estimate based on @maldives_census2022 household count and SIDS electrification cost benchmarks.] for the roughly `{python} f"{param('Number of Households', category='Connection')/1000:.0f}"` thousand households in the Maldives, representing a total outlay that is modest relative to total transition investment but significant relative to the budgets of individual low-income households. Government or donor financing of connection costs ensures that the transition does not create a two-tier system in which wealthier households gain access to cheaper renewable electricity while poorer households remain stranded on expensive diesel supply.
