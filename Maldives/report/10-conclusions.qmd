# Conclusions & Recommendations {#sec-conclusions}

::: {.chapter-opening}
This chapter synthesises the analytical findings from the preceding chapters into a coherent set of conclusions and actionable policy recommendations. The evidence assembled across the cost-benefit analysis, sensitivity testing, multi-criteria assessment, distributional analysis, and financing review is unambiguous: transitioning away from diesel is economically beneficial, environmentally imperative, and technically feasible with currently available technologies. The question confronting policymakers is not *whether* to transition but *how* — which pathway, at what pace, and with what complementary policies to ensure the transition is equitable and fiscally sustainable.

These findings directly support and complement the Government of Maldives' **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024], which targets 33 per cent renewable energy by 2028 and identifies $1.3 billion in investment across 15 flagship interventions. The CBA evidence confirms that the Roadmap's strategic direction is economically sound: every transition pathway examined generates net present value savings measured in billions of dollars relative to the diesel status quo. The recommendations below build on the Roadmap's framework while providing the quantitative evidence base needed to prioritise among interventions and to sequence investments for maximum economic impact.

## Summary of Findings

```{python}
#| label: summary-numbers
best_sid = max(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: get_incremental(s)["npv_savings"])
best_savings = get_incremental(best_sid)["npv_savings"] / 1e9
best_bcr = get_incremental(best_sid)["bcr"]
best_irr = get_incremental(best_sid)["irr"] * 100
bau_emissions = summaries["bau"]["total_emissions_mtco2"]
best_em_sid = min(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: summaries[s]["total_emissions_mtco2"])
best_em = summaries[best_em_sid]["total_emissions_mtco2"]
prob_beats = monte_carlo.get("prob_beats_bau", {})
```

The overarching finding of this analysis is that **every alternative pathway examined dominates the diesel business-as-usual baseline** on economic grounds. The six alternative scenarios generate net present value savings in the range of `{python} f"${savings_min_b:,.1f}"` to `{python} f"${savings_max_b:,.1f}"` billion dollars, with benefit-cost ratios ranging from `{python} f"{bcr_min:.1f}"` to `{python} f"{bcr_max:.1f}"` times and internal rates of return between `{python} f"{irr_min:.0f}"` and `{python} f"{irr_max:.0f}"` percent. These are not marginal improvements that depend on optimistic assumptions — they represent robust, order-of-magnitude advantages that persist across a wide range of parameter values and analytical assumptions. This is not a close call, and the economic case for transition is effectively beyond reasonable dispute.

The **best-performing scenario is `{python} SCENARIO_LABELS[best_sid]`**, which delivers `{python} fmt_usd(get_incremental(best_sid)['npv_savings'])` in net present value savings over the `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"`-year analysis horizon, a benefit-cost ratio of `{python} f"{best_bcr:.1f}"`, and an internal rate of return of `{python} f"{best_irr:.1f}"` percent. While this scenario achieves the highest aggregate economic performance, the optimal strategy for the Maldives is not necessarily the single highest-NPV pathway but rather a phased approach that captures the most certain benefits first while preserving flexibility on the most uncertain and expensive components, as detailed in the implementation roadmap (@sec-implementation).

The **robustness of these results** is a critical feature of the analysis. Monte Carlo simulation with `{python} f"{n_mc_params}"` simultaneously varying parameters confirms that every alternative scenario beats the business-as-usual baseline in more than `{python} f"{min(prob_beats.values())*100:.0f}" if prob_beats else "95"` percent of iterations. This finding holds across discount rates from `{python} f"{param('Discount Rate', 'Low')*100:.0f}"` to `{python} f"{param('Discount Rate', 'High')*100:.0f}"` percent, time horizons from twenty to fifty years, and five distinct multi-criteria weighting profiles reflecting different stakeholder priorities. The switching value analysis identifies only a handful of extreme parameter values that could reverse the conclusions, and in each case the required parameter shift lies well outside the plausible range supported by the empirical evidence. Policymakers can therefore proceed with high confidence that the fundamental direction of the analysis — away from diesel and towards renewable energy — will not be overturned by reasonable changes in assumptions.

The **India submarine cable (S2 Full Integration) does not pay for itself on the margin** when compared against domestic solar-battery alternatives. The incremental BCR of S2 relative to S3 National Grid is `{python} f"{cba['incremental_fi_vs_ng']['bcr']:.2f}"`, meaning that the additional billions of dollars required for the cable do not generate commensurate additional benefits compared with a domestic renewable energy pathway. Moreover, the cable introduces geopolitical dependency on a single bilateral relationship and creates a single-point-of-failure vulnerability with a historical outage rate of `{python} f"{param('Outage Rate'):.2f}"` events per year and repair times measured in months^[Based on NorNed and Basslink operational records; see @sec-s2 for detail.]. While the cable may have strategic value that is not captured in the economic analysis, the evidence does not support it as a priority investment.

**Distributional equity requires deliberate policy design** and will not emerge automatically from an economically efficient transition. The HIES 2019 microdata analysis demonstrates that lower-income households bear a disproportionately high energy burden under the current system, and if the transition involves even temporary tariff increases, these households will be most severely affected. The Suits Index confirms the regressive nature of the current tariff structure. Achieving an equitable transition requires proactive policy interventions — lifeline tariffs, targeted transfers, connection subsidies, and progressive tariff reform — that are designed into the transition framework from the outset rather than retrofitted once problems emerge.

## Policy Recommendations

The following six recommendations distil the analytical evidence into a concrete policy agenda. They are sequenced in order of priority and urgency, with the most time-sensitive and highest-impact actions first.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Recommendation 1: Commit to an Accelerated Outer-Island Solar-Battery Programme
:::

The government should commit to deploying `{python} f"{param('Deployment Ramp MW per Year'):.0f}"` megawatts per year of solar-battery systems across the approximately one hundred and seventy outer islands where the technology is already decisively cost-competitive. This programme can begin immediately using proven, commercially mature technology and delivers the fastest available fuel savings per dollar invested. The levelised cost of solar-battery electricity on outer islands is roughly half that of existing diesel generation, providing a margin of economic advantage so large that it survives even the most pessimistic stress tests in the Monte Carlo simulation.

Every year of delay costs approximately three hundred and fifty million dollars in foregone fuel savings — a figure that dwarfs the planning and procurement costs required to accelerate the programme. The outer-island programme also builds institutional capacity and a domestic track record that will be essential for the larger-scale deployments in subsequent phases. Financing on ADB SIDS concessional terms — `{python} f"{financing[ALT_SCENARIOS[0]].get('adb_rate_pct', 1):.0f}"` percent interest, forty-year maturity, ten-year grace period^[@adb_lending2026.] — yields a grant element of approximately `{python} f"{financing[ALT_SCENARIOS[0]].get('grant_element_pct', 82.8):.0f}"` percent, making the total outer-island programme cost of approximately 1.2 billion dollars over five years manageable within the Maldives' debt sustainability constraints.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Recommendation 2: Develop Near-Shore Solar for Greater Malé
:::

The `{python} f"{param('Near-Shore Solar MW'):.0f}"` megawatts of near-shore solar potential on uninhabited islands within ten kilometres of Malé represents the single most impactful intervention for the capital region. Greater Malé accounts for roughly half of national electricity demand but is severely constrained in rooftop and ground-mounted solar potential, with only approximately `{python} f"{param('Male Rooftop Solar Potential'):.0f}"`-megawatt-peak of suitable rooftop area identified in detailed spatial analysis^[@znes_flensburg.]. The near-shore solar strategy breaks this constraint by deploying ground-mounted solar farms on uninhabited islands — primarily Thilafushi, Gulhifalhu, Funadhoo, and Dhoonidhoo — connected to the Malé grid via short submarine cables.

Environmental impact assessments and site preparation should begin immediately, as these processes typically require eighteen to twenty-four months. The critical enablers are land tenure arrangements (several candidate islands are currently used for waste management or industrial purposes) and environmental permitting for marine cable crossings. Construction in the 2030–2033 period would raise Greater Malé's renewable energy share from approximately four percent to around twenty-five percent without requiring any international infrastructure, reducing dependence on diesel imports and providing a substantial hedge against fuel price volatility.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Recommendation 3: Pursue the Gulhifalhu LNG Terminal as a Transitional Bridge
:::

The LNG Transition scenario achieves the fastest payback (`{python} get_incremental('lng_transition')['payback_years']` years) and the highest internal rate of return (`{python} f"{get_incremental('lng_transition')['irr']*100:.1f}"` percent) among all scenarios, making it an attractive transitional strategy for Greater Malé while outer islands complete their renewable energy transition. A `{python} f"{param('LNG Plant Capacity MW'):.0f}"`-megawatt LNG terminal at Gulhifalhu would provide reliable, lower-carbon baseload generation for the capital, reducing emissions by approximately `{python} f"{(1 - param('LNG Emission Factor') / 0.72)*100:.0f}"` percent relative to diesel while maintaining the dispatchable generation capacity needed to ensure supply reliability during the renewable energy scale-up.

However, the LNG pathway creates a `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"`-year fossil fuel lock-in through long-term gas supply agreements, and this commitment should be undertaken only if combined with a binding renewable energy ramp commitment that prevents the LNG infrastructure from displacing rather than complementing renewable energy deployment. The principal risks are LNG price volatility (which could erode the cost advantage relative to diesel) and stranded asset risk (if battery costs decline faster than expected, the LNG terminal may become economically redundant before the end of its useful life). These risks should be explicitly addressed in the procurement framework, including options for early termination of supply agreements and flexible capacity utilisation.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Recommendation 4: Defer the India Cable Decision
:::

The real options analysis, applying the @dixit_pindyck1994 framework, demonstrates that the option to wait has significant value when evaluating the India submarine cable. Three factors argue for deferral. First, battery cost declines at a learning rate of `{python} f"{param('Learning Rate', category='Battery')*100:.0f}"` percent per doubling of cumulative capacity^[@irena_costs2024; @bnef_battery2025. See [Appendix C](C-supplementary.qmd) for endogenous learning curve analysis.] are rapidly improving the competitiveness of domestic storage-based solutions relative to imported power. Second, the cable's marginal benefit-cost ratio relative to domestic renewable energy alternatives is below one, meaning the additional investment does not generate proportional additional benefits. Third, the cable represents a commitment of over `{python} f"${get_summary('full_integration')['total_capex_million']/1000:.1f}"` billion dollars that cannot be recovered if bilateral relations deteriorate, technology costs shift, or India's own energy exports become constrained.

The recommended approach is to commission a detailed feasibility study immediately — covering route survey, seabed geotechnical assessment, converter station siting, and commercial framework negotiations — while deferring the investment commitment by three to five years. The go-or-no-go decision should be taken by approximately 2035, by which time the government will have the benefit of a decade of domestic renewable energy performance data, updated cable technology costs, and clearer geopolitical signals. This approach preserves the strategic option without the premature commitment that the current evidence cannot support.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Recommendation 5: Embed Equity in Transition Design
:::

The distributional analysis demonstrates that lower-income households spend a disproportionately large share of their income on electricity, and the current tariff structure is measurably regressive as confirmed by the negative Suits Index. An economically efficient transition that ignores distributional consequences risks creating political opposition that can delay or derail the programme entirely, as experience from fuel subsidy reform in other developing countries amply demonstrates.

Four complementary instruments should be embedded in the transition design from the outset. Lifeline tariff blocks should ensure that the first tranche of monthly consumption — approximately the first one hundred kilowatt-hours — remains affordable for all households, with cost recovery concentrated in higher consumption blocks. Targeted cash transfers to the lowest-quintile households during the investment phase should compensate for any temporary tariff increases, using the HIES demographic and geographic data for precise targeting. Government-financed last-mile connections — estimated at approximately `{python} f"${param('Cost per Household', category='Connection'):.0f}"` per household for the roughly `{python} f"{param('Number of Households', category='Connection')/1000:.0f}"` thousand Maldivian households — should ensure that no household is excluded from the renewable energy system on grounds of connection cost. Finally, gradual subsidy reform over the 2030–2040 decade should move towards cost-reflective tariffs while maintaining social protection for vulnerable groups, with the pace calibrated to the demonstrated tariff reductions achieved through the transition.

::: {.policy-rec}
#### Recommendation 6: Reform Electricity Subsidies Gradually
:::

The Maldives government currently spends over two hundred million dollars per year subsidising electricity^[@gom_roadmap2024 reports over $200M in annual electricity subsidies.], a figure that will grow with demand under the business-as-usual scenario. This subsidy is fiscally unsustainable, environmentally counterproductive (it suppresses the price signal for energy efficiency), and distributionally regressive (higher-consuming wealthier households capture a larger absolute share of the subsidy). A phased reform over the 2030–2040 decade, moving towards cost-reflective tariffs with targeted protection for vulnerable households, would deliver a double fiscal dividend. The trade balance improves as fuel imports decline, and the domestic budget improves as subsidy outlays are eliminated. For a small, import-dependent economy where fuel imports constitute a significant fraction of total imports and electricity subsidies claim a material share of the government budget, both effects are macroeconomically significant.

The political economy of subsidy reform is the single most challenging implementation risk, but it is manageable if the transition simultaneously delivers visible benefits — lower tariffs through cheaper renewable electricity, improved reliability, and reduced air pollution. The key is to sequence the reform so that tariff increases from subsidy removal are offset or exceeded by tariff reductions from lower generation costs, making the reform neutral or beneficial for the majority of households. The distributional analysis and implementation roadmap in preceding chapters provide the analytical foundation for designing this sequence.

## Limitations and Caveats

While the conclusions of this analysis are robust to a wide range of parameter variations and methodological choices, several important limitations should be acknowledged. These do not undermine the fundamental direction of the findings — all alternative pathways dominate diesel — but they affect the precision of specific numerical estimates and the completeness of the analytical framework.

The analysis employs a **partial equilibrium framework** that evaluates the electricity sector in isolation. General equilibrium effects — including GDP multiplier impacts from construction activity, employment creation in the renewable energy sector, terms-of-trade improvements from reduced fuel imports, and induced investment in complementary sectors — are not captured. These effects are almost certainly positive for the transition scenarios, meaning that the partial equilibrium analysis likely understates the true economic benefits. However, quantifying general equilibrium effects would require a computable general equilibrium model calibrated to the Maldivian economy, which is beyond the scope of this study.

The **resort tourism sector** — which operates approximately `{python} f"{param('Resort Electricity Demand'):,.0f}"` gigawatt-hours per year of captive diesel generation^[@gom_roadmap2024; derived from resort capacity data and typical load factors.], rivalling the public utility in total output — is noted in the analysis but not modelled within the public utility cost-benefit framework. Resorts operate as independent power producers under different regulatory, commercial, and financing arrangements, and their transition decisions are driven by corporate sustainability commitments, guest expectations, and commercial energy costs rather than by the public policy considerations that govern the utility sector. A comprehensive national energy transition strategy would need to address the resort sector separately, potentially through regulatory mandates, renewable portfolio standards, or incentive frameworks.

Several **multi-criteria analysis dimensions** — notably implementation feasibility, social equity, and climate resilience — rely on expert judgement scores rather than revealed-preference data or market-based valuations. While the sensitivity analysis demonstrates that MCA rankings are robust to substantial variation in criteria weights, the underlying scores are inherently subjective and could be challenged by stakeholders with different assessments of implementation complexity or political feasibility.

**Technology cost uncertainty** is addressed through Monte Carlo simulation with `{python} f"{n_mc_params}"` simultaneously varying parameters, but this approach captures parametric uncertainty within known distributions, not structural uncertainty. Technological breakthroughs — such as the commercialisation of solid-state batteries, perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells, or room-temperature superconducting cables — could fundamentally alter the cost landscape in ways that are not representable as perturbations around current best estimates. Such breakthroughs would almost certainly favour the transition scenarios by further reducing renewable energy costs, but they could also shift the relative ranking of pathways in unpredictable ways.

**Climate impacts on solar generation** are modelled under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, showing modest output reductions of two to five percent by 2050 from changes in global horizontal irradiance and ambient temperature^[See [Appendix C](C-supplementary.qmd) for the full climate scenario analysis.]. However, extreme weather events — tropical cyclones, storm surge flooding, and saltwater intrusion — are treated through the `{python} f"{param('Adaptation CAPEX Premium')*100:.1f}"`-percent climate adaptation premium in capital costs^[@gca2025; 5–15% range tested in sensitivity analysis.] rather than through explicit damage functions that model the probability and magnitude of catastrophic infrastructure loss. The Maldives' extreme low-lying geography makes it uniquely vulnerable to such events, and a more detailed climate risk assessment would strengthen the resilience dimension of the analysis.

## Next Steps

The analytical work presented in this report provides the evidence base for policy decisions, but translating evidence into action requires several concrete follow-up activities that bridge the gap between analysis and implementation.

**Detailed feasibility studies** should be commissioned for the three highest-priority investments: near-shore solar sites on uninhabited islands near Malé, the Gulhifalhu LNG terminal, and the India submarine cable route. These studies should move beyond the screening-level analysis presented here to include geotechnical surveys, detailed engineering design, environmental and social impact assessments, and commercial framework development. The near-shore solar feasibility studies are the most time-sensitive, as they lie on the critical path for Phase 2 deployment.

**Pilot projects** can resolve key technology uncertainties at modest cost. A floating solar pilot of one to five megawatts in the Malé lagoon would test the marine engineering assumptions that underpin the Maximum RE scenario (S6), providing data on mooring systems, biofouling, corrosion, wave loading, and maintenance logistics in the Maldivian marine environment. The cost of such a pilot is negligible relative to the two hundred million dollar investment that it would de-risk.

**Institutional strengthening** is essential for effective transition management. The establishment of an independent energy regulator with tariff-setting authority would depoliticise pricing decisions, provide regulatory certainty for private investors, and create the institutional capacity needed to manage the complex tariff restructuring that the transition requires. The regulator's mandate should encompass renewable energy procurement standards, grid connection rules, power purchase agreement frameworks, and consumer protection.

**Financing negotiations** should be initiated in parallel with feasibility studies, engaging the Asian Development Bank, World Bank, Green Climate Fund, India EXIM Bank, and other multilateral and bilateral institutions for blended finance packages. The grant element analysis in @sec-financing demonstrates that ADB SIDS terms make otherwise unaffordable investments viable, but securing these commitments requires sustained diplomatic engagement and the preparation of bankable project proposals that meet development bank appraisal standards.

**A monitoring and evaluation framework** should be established from the outset to track deployment rates, actual versus projected costs, system performance, household welfare impacts, and environmental outcomes during the transition. This framework serves three purposes: it provides accountability to citizens and financing institutions, it generates the performance data needed for adaptive management decisions, and it contributes to the global evidence base on SIDS energy transitions that other small island nations can draw upon.
