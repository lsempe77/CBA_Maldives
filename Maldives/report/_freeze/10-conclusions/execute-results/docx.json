CBA, Monte Carlo, multi-criteria scoring, distributional analysis, and financing review all confirm that the Maldives gains by transitioning from diesel. What remains is sequencing, financing, and political will.\n\nThe findings align with the Government of Maldives’ **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024], which targets 33 per cent renewable energy by 2028 and identifies $1.3 billion in investment across 15 flagship interventions. The CBA confirms the Roadmap’s strategic direction: all transition pathways generate NPV savings of $10\\.3–13\\.8 billion. The recommendations below build on that framework with the quantitative evidence needed to prioritise and sequence investments.\n:::\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\n\n\n**All six alternatives outperform diesel BAU by wide margins.** NPV savings range from $10\\.3 to $13\\.8 billion, BCRs from 2\\.9–12\\.4, and IRRs from 0–0 percent. These results hold across discount rates, time horizons, and stress tests.\n\n**S6 — Maximum RE** delivers the highest NPV ($13\\.8B, BCR 9\\.1, IRR 36\\.5%). However, the optimal strategy is a phased approach that captures near-certain benefits first while preserving flexibility on uncertain components (@sec-implementation).\n\n**Robustness.** Monte Carlo with 48 parameters confirms every alternative beats BAU in >100% of iterations, across discount rates (3–12%), horizons (20–50 years), and five MCA weight profiles.\n\n**The India cable does not pay for itself on the margin.** Incremental BCR versus S3 National Grid: 0\\.78. Outage rate is 0\\.15/year, with repairs lasting months.^[NorNed and Basslink records; see @sec-s2.]\n\n**Equity requires active design.** HIES 2019 shows lower-income households bear disproportionate energy burden.\n\n## Policy Recommendations\n\nSix recommendations, ordered by priority and urgency:\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Recommendation 1: Commit to an Accelerated Outer-Island Solar-Battery Programme\n:::\n\nDeploy 80 MW/year of solar-battery across ~170 outer islands. Outer-island solar-battery LCOE is roughly half diesel's. Each year of delay forgoes ~$350M in fuel savings. ADB SIDS terms (1% interest, 40-year maturity, 10-year grace)^[@adb_lending2026.] yield ~83% grant element, making the ~$1.2B five-year programme manageable.\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Recommendation 2: Develop Near-Shore Solar for Greater Malé\n:::\n\nGreater Malé (half of national demand) has only ~34 MWp of rooftop potential.^[@znes_flensburg.] The 104 MW near-shore solar strategy breaks this constraint via ground-mounted farms on Thilafushi, Gulhifalhu, Funadhoo, and Dhoonidhoo, connected by short submarine cables.\n\nEIAs and site preparation (18–24 months) should begin immediately. Critical enablers: land tenure (several sites currently used for waste/industry) and marine cable permitting. Construction in 2030–2033 would raise Greater Malé's RE share from ~4% to ~25% with no international infrastructure.\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Recommendation 3: Pursue the Gulhifalhu LNG Terminal as a Transitional Bridge\n:::\n\nLNG achieves the fastest payback (6 years) and highest IRR (44\\.2%) — an attractive bridge for Greater Malé. A 140 MW Gulhifalhu terminal cuts emissions ~44% versus diesel while providing dispatchable capacity.\n\nRisk: LNG creates 30-year lock-in via supply agreements. Procurement must include binding RE ramp commitments, early termination options, and flexible utilisation clauses to prevent LNG from displacing (rather than bridging) renewables.\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Recommendation 4: Defer the India Cable Decision\n:::\n\nReal options analysis [@dixit_pindyck1994] shows the option to wait has value. Three factors favour deferral: (1) battery costs declining at 18%/doubling^[@irena_costs2024; @bnef_battery2025. See [Appendix C](C-supplementary.qmd).] are improving domestic alternatives; (2) the cable's incremental BCR versus S3 is <1; (3) the $4\\.5B commitment cannot be recovered if bilateral relations or technology costs shift.\n\nRecommended approach: commission detailed feasibility (route survey, geotechnical, converter siting, commercial terms) now, defer investment 3–5 years. Go/no-go by ~2035, when a decade of RE performance data and updated cable costs will inform the decision.\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Recommendation 5: Embed Equity in Transition Design\n:::\n\nLower-income households bear disproportionate energy burden (negative Suits Index).\n\nFour instruments from the outset: (1) lifeline tariffs — first ~100 kWh affordable, cost recovery in upper blocks; (2) targeted cash transfers to lowest-quintile households, using HIES data; (3) government-financed connections (~$200/household × 100k households); (4) gradual 2030–2040 subsidy reform calibrated to RE-driven tariff reductions.\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Recommendation 6: Reform Electricity Subsidies Gradually\n:::\n\nThe government spends >$200M/year on electricity subsidies^[@gom_roadmap2024.] — a burden that is fiscally unsustainable and regressive. Phased reform (2030–2040) toward cost-reflective tariffs with targeted protection delivers a double dividend: improved trade balance and reduced budget burden.\n\nPolitical economy is the key risk. The sequence must ensure subsidy-removal tariff increases are offset by RE-driven cost reductions, making reform neutral or beneficial for most households.\n\n## Limitations and Caveats\n\nThe conclusions are robust across parameter ranges and methods, but limitations affect the precision of numerical estimates:\n\n**Partial equilibrium.** GDP multipliers, employment effects, and improvements to the trade balance from reduced fuel imports are all excluded from the quantitative model.\n\n**Resort sector.** Resorts operate ~1\\,050 GWh/year of captive diesel generation^[@gom_roadmap2024.] — rivalling the utility — but are not modelled here. A comprehensive strategy would address resorts via mandates or incentives.\n\n**MCA subjectivity.** Implementation feasibility, social equity, and climate resilience scores rely on expert judgement.\n\n**Technology uncertainty.** Monte Carlo captures parametric uncertainty, not structural breakthroughs (solid-state batteries, perovskite cells). Such breakthroughs would likely favour transition but could shift scenario rankings unpredictably.\n\n**Climate risk.** RCP 4.5/8.5 scenarios show 2–5% solar output reduction by 2050.^[See [Appendix C](C-supplementary.qmd).] Extreme events (cyclones, storm surge) are treated via a 7\\.5% CAPEX premium^[@gca2025.] rather than explicit damage functions.\n\n## Next Steps\n\n**Feasibility studies** for near-shore solar, Gulhifalhu LNG, and India cable route: geotechnical surveys, engineering design, EIAs, and commercial frameworks.\n\n**Pilots.** A 1–5 MW floating solar pilot in Malé lagoon tests mooring, biofouling, and maintenance for S6. A wind pilot on an uninhabited atoll validates the 80 MW component. Cost is negligible relative to de-risked investments.\n\n**Independent regulator.** An energy regulator with tariff-setting authority depoliticises pricing, provides investor certainty, and manages tariff restructuring. Mandate: RE procurement standards, grid connection rules, PPA frameworks, consumer protection.\n\n**Financing.** Engage ADB, World Bank, GCF, India EXIM in parallel with feasibility work. ADB SIDS terms make investments viable (@sec-financing), but require bankable proposals meeting development bank standards.\n\n**M&E framework.** Track deployment, costs, performance, welfare, and environmental outcomes. A well-designed monitoring system provides accountability and feeds adaptive management. It would also contribute to the thin global evidence base on SIDS energy transitions.\n\n",
