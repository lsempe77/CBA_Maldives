This report presents a **cost-benefit analysis (CBA)** of seven alternative electricity transition pathways over 30 years (2026 – 2056  ).\n\nThe analysis builds on the Government of Maldives' **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024], which targets 33% renewable energy by 2028 and identifies 490 MW of solar potential across 15 interventions ($1.3 billion estimated investment). The seven scenarios examined here provide the economic evidence base for prioritising among those interventions.\n\n### What this report offers policymakers {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nAll six alternative pathways yield present-value savings of **$10\\.3 billion to $13\\.8 billion** compared with continued diesel dependence.\n:::\n\n- **Seven scenarios** — from an India submarine cable to islanded solar+battery systems, compared on a common framework\n- **Open, reproducible methods** — parameter sources documented; code available\n- **Policy-oriented outputs** — financing structures and distributional equity, with multi-criteria ranking to support decision-making\n- **Uncertainty analysis** — 48-parameter Monte Carlo, tornado diagrams, switching-value analysis\n\n### How to read this report {.unnumbered}\n\n| If you have... | Read... |\n|---|---|\n| **5 minutes** | [Executive Summary](executive-summary.qmd) — key findings on one page |\n| **30 minutes** | Parts I–II — full context, scenarios, and results |\n| **2 hours** | The complete report including policy chapters |\n| **Technical review** | Appendices A–C for full methodology, parameters, and supplementary analyses |\n\n### Headline comparison {.unnumbered}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Net present value of savings versus BAU (diesel) for each transition scenario, 2026–2056, 6% discount rate.](index_files/figure-pdf/fig-headline-output-1.png){#fig-headline}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Statement on the use of AI tools {.unnumbered}\n\nThis report was prepared with the aid of large language models (GitHub Copilot, powered by Claude, Anthropic).
