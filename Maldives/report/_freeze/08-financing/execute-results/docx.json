Concessional ADB SIDS lending terms (1% interest, 40-year maturity, 10-year grace) carry a grant element of ~83%, which transforms capital-intensive pathways from aspirational to fiscally manageable.\n:::\n\n## Total Investment Requirements\n\nInvestment varies widely: some pathways require concentrated front-loaded capital; others permit modular phasing.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Total nominal CAPEX by scenario. Full Integration has the highest upfront investment requirement; Islanded Green can be deployed incrementally.](08-financing_files/figure-docx/fig-capex-comparison-output-1.png){#fig-capex-comparison}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-capex-comparison shows S2 (Full Integration) commanding the highest CAPEX (submarine cable, converters, grid), while S4 (Islanded Green) requires far less (distributed solar-battery, no interconnection). S3, S5, S6, S7 fall between. Modular pathways deliver value from the first unit and scale with fiscal conditions.\n\n## Financing Structure: Blended Concessional Finance\n\nADB SIDS terms (1% interest, 40-year maturity, 10-year grace)^[@adb_lending2026.] deliver a grant element of ~**82\\.8%**, far below commercial rates.\n\n\n\nFor every dollar at ADB terms, the Maldives pays back far less than at commercial rates (11\\.6%), transforming capital-intensive pathways into viable investments.\n\n## Fiscal Sustainability: Debt Service Burden\n\nThe IMF flags debt service above ~2% of GDP as a sustainability threshold^[@imf_dst2023.].\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Peak annual debt service as a percentage of GDP for each scenario.](08-financing_files/figure-docx/fig-debt-service-output-1.png){#fig-debt-service}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-debt-service shows peak debt service as % of GDP (red line = 2% threshold). Below the line = fiscally sustainable. The 10-year grace provides breathing room during construction.\n\n## Household Bill Impact\n\nProjected annual household bills translate macro financing into micro affordability:\n\n\n\nLower LCOE translates directly into lower bills. Average figures mask quintile variation (see @sec-distributional); lifeline blocks can substantially alter distributional incidence.\n\n## Subsidy Avoidance\n\n\n\nCurrent subsidy: ~**$0\\.15/kWh**^[@gom_roadmap2024]. At 2030 demand (1\\,459 GWh), this = ~**$0M/yr** — a recurring drain that grows with demand and spikes with oil prices. Transition to lower-cost RE progressively eliminates this outlay, recovering fiscal space for health, education, or adaptation.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nEnergy transition delivers two fiscal gains at once: (1) reduced fuel imports improve the trade balance and preserve foreign exchange reserves; (2) reduced electricity subsidies free domestic budget space for health, education, or climate adaptation.\n:::\n\n",
