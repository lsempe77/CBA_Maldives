Implementation feasibility, climate resilience, and distributional equity also matter for a decision of this scale. This chapter scores each scenario against eight criteria.\n:::\n\n## Framework: Eight Criteria\n\nFollowing @adb_guidelines2017 §7.3 and @dodgson2009, eight criteria cover the economic, environmental, social, and institutional dimensions of the transition decision. Five are computed directly from CBA outputs; three (feasibility, equity, climate resilience) are expert-scored on a 0–1 scale. Economic efficiency receives the largest weight, but the combined non-economic criteria ensure that a scenario cannot rank highly on economics alone.\n\n\n\n| Criterion | Weight | Metric | Source |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Economic Efficiency | 18% | NPV savings vs. BAU | CBA model output |\n| Environmental Impact | 14% | Cumulative CO₂ reduction | CBA model output |\n| Energy Security | 14% | Final RE share | CBA model output |\n| Health Benefits | 9% | Health co-benefits ($M) | CBA model output |\n| Fiscal Burden | 9% | Total CAPEX (lower = better) | CBA model output |\n| Implementation Feasibility | 10% | Expert assessment (0–1) | Expert scoring |\n| Social Equity | 9% | Expert assessment (0–1) | Expert scoring |\n| Climate Resilience | 9% | Expert assessment (0–1) | Expert scoring |\n\nThe weight sensitivity analysis below tests whether rankings hold under alternative weighting schemes.\n\n## Results: Weighted Scores\n\nTotal weighted MCA scores (higher = better), with each criterion normalised 0–1 before applying weights:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![MCA weighted scores by scenario. Higher is better. S6 (Maximum RE) ranks first under base weights.](06-mca_files/figure-pdf/fig-mca-ranking-output-1.png){#fig-mca-ranking}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe MCA reinforces the CBA findings while adding nuance. High-RE scenarios (S6, S3, S5) cluster at the top: they combine fuel savings with deep emissions reductions, energy independence, and health co-benefits. Fossil-retaining pathways (LNG, cable) score well on economic efficiency but are penalised on environment, security, and resilience.\n\nThe heatmap disaggregates scores by criterion (darker green = better):\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Normalised scores by criterion and scenario. Darker green indicates better performance.](06-mca_files/figure-pdf/fig-mca-heatmap-output-1.png){#fig-mca-heatmap}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRenewable-intensive pathways score well on environmental impact, energy security, and health but may lag on fiscal burden and feasibility. The India cable (S2) pairs high economic efficiency with weaker security and resilience — single-point-of-failure risk and geopolitical exposure. LNG (S7) scores well on economics and feasibility but lower on environment. S4 (Islanded Green) ranks well on feasibility and equity but lower on environmental impact because Malé retains more diesel without near-shore or floating solar.\n\n## Weight Sensitivity: Does the Ranking Hold?\n\nDifferent stakeholders assign different weights. The test below runs five alternative profiles (environment-first, fiscal-first, social-equity, balanced, etc.):\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![MCA rankings under five different weight profiles. A stable ranking across profiles indicates robustness.](06-mca_files/figure-pdf/fig-weight-sensitivity-output-1.png){#fig-weight-sensitivity}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nTop-performing scenarios hold their positions across all five weight profiles. The ranking is not sensitive to how criteria are weighted, which means the conclusions rest on performance, not on the weighting scheme.\n:::\n\nThis stability across weight profiles indicates that the top scenarios genuinely dominate on multiple fronts rather than benefiting from a single favourable assumption.\n\n**Limitations:** Three expert-scored criteria involve judgement, normalisation can compress meaningful differences, and the linear additive model assumes full compensability between criteria.\n\n",
