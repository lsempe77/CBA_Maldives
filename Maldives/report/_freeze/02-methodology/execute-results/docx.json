Full equations appear in [Appendix A](A-methodology-detail.qmd); parameters with sources and sensitivity ranges in [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd).\n:::\n\n## CBA Framework {#sec-methodology}\n\nSocial CBA adopts society’s perspective rather than a private investor’s, valuing externalities (carbon emissions, health damages) that commercial analysis would ignore and discounting at a social rate rather than a market one.\n\nFor each of the seven scenarios, the model computes the net present value of all costs and benefits over the analysis horizon:\n\n$$\nNPV_s = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{B_{s,t} - C_{s,t}}{(1+r)^t}\n$$\n\nwhere $B_{s,t}$ represents the total benefits (fuel savings, avoided emissions, health and environmental co-benefits, and reliability improvements) and $C_{s,t}$ represents the total costs (capital, operating, fuel, and power purchase costs) of scenario $s$ in year $t$, discounted at the social rate $r$ = 6 per cent.\n\nThe decision criterion is the incremental analysis, which compares each alternative scenario against the diesel business-as-usual counterfactual:\n\n$$\n\\Delta NPV_s = NPV_{BAU} - NPV_s\n$$\n\nA positive incremental NPV indicates that the alternative pathway generates net savings relative to continued diesel dependence. This formulation follows standard practice in public investment appraisal, where the counterfactual (what happens without the project) must be explicitly defined to avoid counting benefits that would have occurred regardless.\n\n### Key Metrics\n\nThe analysis reports four complementary economic performance metrics:\n\n| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **BCR** | Total benefits ÷ Total additional costs | Values > 1.0 indicate net positive returns |\n| **IRR** | Rate $r^*$ where $NPV = 0$ | Higher is better; compare to hurdle rate |\n| **LCOE** | PV(costs) ÷ PV(generation) | Levelised unit cost in $/kWh |\n| **Payback** | Year when cumulative savings turn positive | Shorter is better |\n\nNPV and BCR serve as the primary decision criteria per @adb_guidelines2017. IRR and payback are secondary indicators that speak to different audiences: finance ministries tend to focus on BCR, while development partners track IRR.\n\n## Benefit Streams\n\nThe analysis quantifies five benefit categories for each scenario relative to diesel BAU.\n\n**Fuel cost savings** make up the largest component. Each kilowatt-hour from solar, wind, or imported electricity displaces diesel that would otherwise be burned. Diesel fuel is projected to cost $0\\.85 per litre in 2026^[Based on recent Maldives import parity price data; see [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd) for sources and sensitivity ranges.], escalating at 2 per cent per year in real terms.\n\n**Avoided emissions.** Each tonne of CO₂ not emitted is valued at the US EPA Social Cost of Carbon [@epa_scc2023]: approximately $190 per tonne in 2026, growing at 2 per cent per year in real terms.\n\n**Health co-benefits.** Diesel generators emit PM₂.₅, NOₓ, and SO₂, with health effects concentrated in communities adjacent to powerhouses. Following @parry2014, these damages are valued at $40 per MWh of avoided diesel generation.\n\n**Reliability.** Outer-island diesel systems suffer frequent breakdowns from ageing equipment and fuel supply disruptions. Lost load is valued at $5 per kWh of unserved energy^[VOLL consistent with developing-country valuation literature; see [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd).].\n\n**Other environmental externalities.** Diesel imposes costs beyond carbon: generator noise near residential areas ($5/MWh), fuel spill risk ($3/MWh), and biodiversity impacts from marine contamination ($2/MWh) — totalling $10 per MWh^[See [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd) for component sources and sensitivity ranges.].\n\n## Discount Rate\n\n\n\nThe discount rate governs the relative weight of near-term costs against distant future benefits, a choice that matters for capital-intensive infrastructure with 30- to 50-year payoff horizons.\n\nThe base case analysis uses a **6 per cent real social discount rate**, following @adb_guidelines2017 §4.12 for developing-country members. This rate reflects the social opportunity cost of capital in developing economies — the return that could be earned on the best alternative public investment — and is the standard rate used in ADB-financed project appraisals across the Asia-Pacific region. Sensitivity analysis covers the full range from 3 per cent (consistent with the @stern2006 approach to intergenerational equity) to 12 per cent (the ADB upper bound for projects with higher-than-average systematic risk).\n\nA declining discount rate (DDR) schedule is also tested, following @hm_treasury2022, @weitzman2001, and @drupp2018. The DDR schedule applies 3\\.5 per cent for years 0 to 30, declining to 3\\.0 per cent for years 31 to 75, and 2\\.5 per cent thereafter. The rationale: uncertainty about future growth rates creates an effective discount rate that falls over time, giving more weight to distant benefits such as avoided climate damages.\n\n## Time Horizon\n\nThe default analysis period is 30 years (2026 – 2056), matching the useful life of solar panels (30 years) and falling within the range of credible demand projections. Submarine cables are designed for 40-year service and LNG terminals for 30–40 years, so a 30-year horizon captures most benefits while avoiding speculative extrapolation.\n\nRobustness checks extend the analysis to a shorter 20-year and a longer 50-year horizon. All infrastructure with remaining useful life at the end of the analysis period receives a salvage value credit based on straight-line depreciation.\n\n## What This Analysis Does Not Cover\n\n**Resort sector.** ~1\\,050 GWh/year of private diesel generation^[@gom_roadmap2024.] — nearly matching the public utility — but off-grid and commercially driven. Emissions are noted for context; a separate commercial analysis would be needed.\n\n**General equilibrium effects.** GDP multipliers, employment gains, and terms-of-trade improvements from lower electricity costs are not modelled. Including them would likely strengthen the transition case.\n\n**Political economy.** Institutional capacity, governance, and coalition-building are treated as exogenous. @sec-implementation addresses implementation qualitatively.\n\n**Demand-side management.** Energy efficiency and demand response are not modelled beyond price elasticity effects. Aggressive efficiency programmes could reduce supply-side investment needs below estimates here.\n\n",
