The framework follows established international practice for public investment appraisal, extended to capture the externalities and distributional concerns that are especially relevant in a small island developing state context. For the full mathematical formulation of every equation in the model, see [Appendix A](A-methodology-detail.qmd). For the complete parameter table with sources and sensitivity ranges, see [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd).\n:::\n\n## CBA Framework {#sec-methodology}\n\nThe analysis follows the standard social cost-benefit analysis framework as prescribed by @adb_guidelines2017 and the canonical textbook treatment of @boardman2018. Social CBA differs from private financial analysis in several important respects: it values costs and benefits from the perspective of society as a whole rather than any individual investor, it includes externalities (such as carbon emissions, health damages, and environmental impacts) that would be ignored in a purely commercial appraisal, and it uses a social discount rate that reflects society's collective time preference rather than the market cost of capital.\n\nFor each of the seven scenarios, the model computes the net present value of all costs and benefits over the analysis horizon:\n\n$$\nNPV_s = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{B_{s,t} - C_{s,t}}{(1+r)^t}\n$$\n\nwhere $B_{s,t}$ represents the total benefits (fuel savings, emission reductions, health improvements, reliability gains, and environmental benefits) and $C_{s,t}$ represents the total costs (capital expenditure, operating expenditure, fuel costs, and power purchase agreement imports) of scenario $s$ in year $t$, discounted at the social rate $r$ = 6 per cent.\n\nThe decision criterion is the incremental analysis, which compares each alternative scenario against the diesel business-as-usual counterfactual:\n\n$$\n\\Delta NPV_s = NPV_{BAU} - NPV_s\n$$\n\nA positive incremental NPV indicates that the alternative pathway generates net savings relative to continued diesel dependence. This formulation follows standard practice in public investment appraisal, where the counterfactual (what happens without the project) must be explicitly defined to avoid counting benefits that would have occurred regardless.\n\n### Key Metrics\n\nThe analysis reports four complementary economic performance metrics, each of which captures a different aspect of a scenario's attractiveness. The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) divides total discounted benefits by total additional discounted costs, with values above 1.0 indicating that the project generates more value than it costs. The internal rate of return (IRR) identifies the discount rate at which the net present value of incremental cash flows equals zero, providing a rate-of-return measure that can be compared against the country's opportunity cost of capital. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) divides the present value of all lifetime costs by the present value of total electricity generation, yielding a per-unit cost metric that allows direct comparison across technologies and scenarios. The payback period identifies the year in which cumulative discounted savings first exceed cumulative discounted costs, indicating how quickly the transition investment begins generating net returns.\n\n| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |\n|---|---|---|\n| **BCR** | Total benefits ÷ Total additional costs | Values > 1.0 indicate net positive returns |\n| **IRR** | Rate $r^*$ where $NPV = 0$ | Higher is better; compare to hurdle rate |\n| **LCOE** | PV(costs) ÷ PV(generation) | Levelised unit cost in $/kWh |\n| **Payback** | Year when cumulative savings turn positive | Shorter is better |\n\nThese four metrics provide complementary perspectives on the same underlying economics. The NPV and BCR are the primary decision criteria recommended by @adb_guidelines2017 for public investment decisions, while the IRR and payback period are useful secondary indicators that speak to different stakeholder concerns. A high BCR indicates strong value for money, a high IRR indicates robustness to discount rate assumptions, and a short payback period indicates rapid fiscal relief — each of which may resonate differently with finance ministries, development partners, and political decision-makers.\n\n## Benefit Streams\n\nFive distinct benefit streams are quantified for each alternative scenario relative to the diesel business-as-usual counterfactual. Each stream represents a real economic gain that society would forgo by continuing with the status quo.\n\nThe first and largest benefit stream is fuel cost savings. Every kilowatt-hour generated from solar, wind, or imported electricity via submarine cable displaces diesel fuel that would otherwise need to be purchased on international markets, shipped to the Maldives, distributed to individual islands, and combusted in generators. Diesel fuel is projected to cost $0\\.85 per litre in 2026^[Based on recent Maldives import parity price data; see [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd) for sources and sensitivity ranges.], escalating at 2 per cent per year in real terms. For scenarios that achieve high renewable energy penetration, the cumulative fuel savings over 30 years run into the billions of dollars.\n\nThe second benefit stream captures the economic value of avoided greenhouse gas emissions. Each tonne of CO₂ not emitted represents a reduction in the global damages caused by climate change, valued using the US Environmental Protection Agency's Social Cost of Carbon [@epa_scc2023], which stands at approximately $190 per tonne in 2026 and grows at 2 per cent per year in real terms as cumulative atmospheric concentrations increase. While the Maldives' emissions are modest in global terms, the SCC provides a theoretically grounded and policy-relevant way to monetise the climate benefit of transition.\n\nThe third benefit stream quantifies the health co-benefits of reducing diesel combustion. Diesel generators emit particulate matter (PM₂.₅), nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), sulphur dioxide (SO₂), and other pollutants that cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, and premature mortality, particularly in communities living near powerhouses. Following the methodology of @parry2014, these health damages are valued at $40 per MWh of diesel generation avoided, reflecting the estimated cost of illness, lost productivity, and mortality risk attributable to diesel exhaust in developing-country settings.\n\nThe fourth benefit stream — reliability benefits — captures the economic value of reduced power outages. Small diesel systems on outer islands experience frequent breakdowns due to ageing equipment, fuel supply disruptions, and limited maintenance capacity. The System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) measures the average duration of outages experienced by customers, and each hour of lost supply is valued at $5 per kWh of unserved energy^[Value of Lost Load (VOLL) estimate consistent with developing-country electricity valuation literature; see [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd).], reflecting the economic cost of disrupted commercial activity, spoiled goods, and household inconvenience.\n\nThe fifth benefit stream encompasses broader environmental externalities beyond carbon emissions. Diesel generation imposes costs that are not captured in fuel prices: noise pollution from generators operating near residential areas (valued at $5 per MWh), the risk of fuel spills from storage, handling, and transport to remote islands ($3 per MWh), and biodiversity impacts from fuel-related marine contamination and infrastructure footprint ($2 per MWh). These values, totalling $10 per MWh, are conservative estimates drawn from the environmental economics literature and applied only to the diesel generation that is displaced by the transition^[See [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd) for individual component sources and sensitivity ranges.].\n\n## Discount Rate\n\n\n\nThe choice of discount rate is among the most consequential methodological decisions in any long-horizon cost-benefit analysis, because it determines the relative weight placed on costs and benefits occurring in the near term versus the distant future. Energy infrastructure investments typically involve large upfront capital expenditures that generate benefits over 30 to 50 years, and the discount rate profoundly affects whether projects with high initial costs but sustained future benefits appear economically attractive.\n\nThe base case analysis uses a **6 per cent real social discount rate**, following @adb_guidelines2017 §4.12 for developing-country members. This rate reflects the social opportunity cost of capital in developing economies — the return that could be earned on the best alternative public investment — and is the standard rate used in ADB-financed project appraisals across the Asia-Pacific region. Sensitivity analysis covers the full range from 3 per cent (consistent with the @stern2006 approach to intergenerational equity) to 12 per cent (the ADB upper bound for projects with higher-than-average systematic risk).\n\nA declining discount rate (DDR) schedule is also tested as a supplementary sensitivity analysis, following the methodology adopted by @hm_treasury2022 and supported by the theoretical work of @weitzman2001 and the empirical survey of @drupp2018. The DDR schedule applies 3\\.5 per cent for years 0 to 30, declining to 3\\.0 per cent for years 31 to 75, and 2\\.5 per cent thereafter. The rationale for declining rates is that uncertainty about future economic growth rates and discount rates creates an effective discount rate that falls over time — meaning that very long-term benefits (such as avoided climate damages) receive more weight under a DDR than under a constant rate. This is particularly relevant for the Maldives, where energy infrastructure generates benefits over 30 to 50 years and the country's vulnerability to climate change gives it an unusually strong stake in long-term outcomes.\n\n## Time Horizon\n\nThe default analysis period is 30 years (2026 – 2056), chosen to capture the full lifecycle of the major infrastructure investments under consideration while remaining within the range of credible demand and technology cost projections. Solar panels have an expected useful life of 30 years, submarine cables are designed for 40-year service, and LNG terminals typically operate for 30 to 40 years. A 30-year horizon is long enough to capture the full stream of benefits from these investments while avoiding the speculative uncertainty that would attend projections further into the future.\n\nRobustness checks extend the analysis to both a shorter 20-year horizon (conservative, capturing only the most certain near-term costs and benefits) and a longer 50-year horizon (which captures the full useful life of submarine cables and allows second-generation solar and battery replacements to be modelled). All infrastructure with remaining useful life at the end of the analysis period receives a salvage value credit based on straight-line depreciation, ensuring that the analysis does not penalise investments whose benefits extend beyond the horizon.\n\n## What This Analysis Does Not Cover\n\nTransparency about the boundaries and limitations of any analytical framework is essential for responsible policy advice. Several important dimensions of the Maldives energy transition are not captured by the model, and policymakers should be aware of these omissions when interpreting the results.\n\nThe analysis does not include the resort sector. The approximately 170 privately operated resort islands consume an estimated 1\\,050 GWh per year of diesel-generated electricity^[@gom_roadmap2024; derived from resort capacity data and typical load factors.] — nearly as much as the entire public utility system. However, these resorts operate off-grid private generation systems that are not subject to public utility regulation or tariff policy, and their investment decisions are driven by commercial rather than social objectives. The resort sector's emissions are noted for national context, but the economic case for transition in that sector requires a separate commercial analysis with different parameters and decision criteria.\n\nThe analysis employs a partial equilibrium CBA framework rather than a general equilibrium model. This means that macroeconomic feedback effects — such as the GDP multiplier from construction spending, the employment effects of building a domestic renewable energy industry, the terms-of-trade improvement from reduced fuel imports, or the impact of lower electricity costs on industrial competitiveness — are not modelled. These general equilibrium effects would likely strengthen the case for transition (because reduced imports improve the trade balance and lower energy costs stimulate economic activity), meaning that the partial equilibrium CBA estimates should be considered conservative in this regard.\n\nThe political economy of transition is identified but not modelled. The analysis identifies optimal pathways from an economic efficiency perspective, but the institutional capacity, governance arrangements, regulatory reforms, and political coalition-building needed to implement these pathways are treated as exogenous. The implementation roadmap in @sec-implementation addresses some of these considerations qualitatively, but a full political economy analysis would require a different methodological approach.\n\nFinally, demand-side management is not explicitly modelled beyond the price elasticity effects that arise in scenarios where the effective cost of electricity changes. Energy efficiency improvements, demand response programmes, time-of-use pricing, and behavioural interventions could all reduce the required scale of supply-side investment, but quantifying their potential requires detailed end-use data that are not currently available for the Maldives. The omission of demand-side measures means that the total investment requirements estimated in this analysis may be higher than necessary if aggressive efficiency programmes are pursued in parallel.\n\n",
