All six alternatives to diesel yield benefit-cost ratios above 2\\.9 ×, with the best-performing options saving over $14 billion in present value.\n:::\n\n## The Challenge\n\n\n\nAbout 93% of the Maldives' electricity comes from imported diesel, burned in isolated generators on each of 187 inhabited islands^[@gom_roadmap2024; @maldives_census2022.] with no interconnected grid. Island-level generators cannot capture scale economies, and generation costs are high. Current demand is 1\\,200 GWh/year, projected to reach 5\\,186 GWh by 2056 under business-as-usual growth.\n\nContinued diesel dependence would cost **$14\\.4 billion in fuel alone** (present value) over thirty years, leaving the budget exposed to oil price swings. Business-as-usual would also produce **65\\.8 million tonnes of CO₂** — difficult to reconcile with the country's climate commitments.\n\nThe results here are consistent with the Government’s **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024], which targets 33% renewable energy by 2028 and calls for $1.3 billion in investment. This CBA provides supporting economic evidence: every alternative pathway examined yields net present value savings of $10\\.3 to $13\\.8 billion relative to diesel.\n\n## Seven Pathways Compared\n\nSeven scenarios, from diesel status quo to various RE and interconnection strategies. @fig-executive-comparison compares total costs and LCOE alongside emissions and RE share.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Comparison of seven energy scenarios across four key metrics. All alternative scenarios outperform diesel BAU.](executive-summary_files/figure-docx/fig-executive-comparison-output-1.png){#fig-executive-comparison}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Costs:** Every alternative beats diesel — avoided fuel outweighs upfront capital. **LCOE:** Solar scenarios deliver power at ~half the diesel cost. **Emissions:** 50–80% lifetime CO₂ reduction. **RE share:** 50% to >95% by 2056.\n\n## The Ranking\n\nRanked by NPV savings versus diesel:\n\n::: {#tbl-ranking .cell tbl-cap='Scenario comparison: key metrics ranked by NPV savings versus BAU.' execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=4}\n| Scenario   | PV Total Costs ($B)   | LCOE ($/kWh)   | NPV Savings ($B)   | BCR   | IRR (%)   |   Payback (yr) |   Emissions (MtCO₂) | Final RE (%)   |\n|:-----------|:----------------------|:---------------|:-------------------|:------|:----------|---------------:|--------------------:|:---------------|\n| S6 MR      | $7.3                  | $0.234         | $13.8              | 9.1×  | 36.5%     |              7 |                21.7 | 64%            |\n| S7 LNG     | $7.2                  | $0.200         | $13.3              | 11.5× | 44.2%     |              6 |                30   | 47%            |\n| S5 NS      | $8.3                  | $0.263         | $12.0              | 11.0× | 37.6%     |              7 |                28.9 | 54%            |\n| S3 NG      | $8.6                  | $0.273         | $11.3              | 12.4× | 38.7%     |              6 |                31.4 | 51%            |\n| S2 FI      | $9.0                  | $0.204         | $10.3              | 2.9×  | 17.0%     |             13 |                46   | 11%            |\n| S4 IG      | $9.6                  | $0.304         | $10.3              | 8.4×  | 29.4%     |              8 |                31.5 | 51%            |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBCRs range from 2\\.9 to 12\\.4× — well above breakeven. Higher RE shares correlate with larger lifetime savings because zero-marginal-cost solar displaces fuel. LNG offers faster near-term returns (higher IRR) despite lower RE penetration, reflecting a trade-off between long-run optimality and implementation speed.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### The margin is wide, not narrow\n\n\n\nEven the *least* advantageous alternative (S4 IG) saves **$10\\.3B** versus diesel. The *best* (S6 MR) saves **$13\\.8B**. These margins hold under wide parameter variation (see @sec-sensitivity).\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### Solar+battery already undercuts diesel\n\n\n\nDomestic solar+battery systems achieve an LCOE of **$0\\.273/kWh** versus diesel’s **$0\\.437/kWh** — a 38% reduction. Battery costs continue falling at a Wright’s Law learning rate of 18%^[@bnef_battery2025.], widening the gap further.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### The India cable introduces single-point-of-failure risk\n\n\n\nFull Integration (India cable) requires **$2\\.0B** more in CAPEX than the National Grid option, with a marginal BCR of only **0\\.78×**. Cable outage records (NorNed, Basslink: λ=0.15/yr, repair 1–6 months) imply a vulnerability that domestic alternatives avoid.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n### Uncertainty does not change the answer\n\n\n\nMonte Carlo simulation (1\\,000 iterations, 48 correlated parameters) shows every alternative beats BAU in **>100%** of draws. Rankings are stable across discount rates (3–12%), time horizons (20–50 years), and five multi-criteria weight profiles.\n:::\n\n## What Should Policymakers Do?\n\nThree priorities:\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### 1. Accelerate Outer-Island Solar+Battery\n\nProven technology, ~half-cost electricity versus diesel, each delay year forgoes ~$0M savings. Target: 50 MW/year, prioritising largest LCOE gaps.\n:::\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### 2. Use LNG as a Bridge for Greater Malé\n\nFastest payback (44\\.2% IRR, 6-year payback). Pair LNG commitment with binding RE ramp to prevent lock-in.\n:::\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### 3. Build Equity Safeguards from the Start\n\nHIES 2019: lower-income households bear disproportionate energy burden. Progressive tariffs and lifeline blocks must be paired with targeted transfers for vulnerable households. Government-financed connections are needed to prevent a two-tier system. These safeguards should be embedded upfront, not retrofitted. See @sec-distributional.\n:::\n\n",
