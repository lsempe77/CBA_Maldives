It examines the present-value costs, savings, benefit-cost ratios, levelised costs of electricity, and emissions trajectories for all seven scenarios, and provides a detailed incremental analysis comparing the India cable against domestic renewable alternatives.\n:::\n\n## The Big Picture: All Alternatives Beat Diesel\n\nThe most important finding of this analysis can be stated simply: every single alternative pathway generates billions of dollars in net economic benefits compared to continued diesel dependence. This result is not marginal or ambiguous — the savings are large, they are consistent across scenarios, and as demonstrated in @sec-sensitivity, they are robust to wide variation in key parameters.\n\n::: {#fig-npv-savings .cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {#fig-npv-savings-1 .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n        <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n        window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};\n        if (window.MathJax && window.MathJax.Hub && window.MathJax.Hub.Config) {window.MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: \"STIX-Web\"}});}\n        </script>\n        <script type=\"module\">import \"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min\"</script>\n        \n```\n\nNet present value of savings versus BAU for each alternative scenario.

The results are unambiguous: every alternative saves the Maldives between $9\\.9 billion and $13\\.0 billion in present value over the 30-year analysis period. The S7 — LNG Transition scenario achieves the highest NPV savings, while even S4 — Islanded Green — the least advantageous alternative — delivers substantial net benefits. The magnitude of these savings reflects the enormous cumulative cost of diesel fuel over three decades, which dwarfs the upfront capital investment required for any of the transition pathways.\n\nIt is worth emphasising that these savings are calculated at a 6 per cent real discount rate, which heavily discounts benefits occurring in later years. At lower discount rates (3–4 per cent, as used by several OECD development agencies), the savings would be even larger, because the long tail of fuel cost avoidance in the 2040s and 2050s receives greater weight. Conversely, even at the high end of the ADB range (12 per cent), all alternatives still dominate diesel — the breakeven discount rate for every scenario is well above 0 per cent.\n\n## Cost Breakdown by Component\n\nUnderstanding *why* the alternatives are cheaper requires examining the composition of costs under each pathway. The stacked bar chart below decomposes the present value of total system costs into four components: capital expenditure (the upfront investment in solar panels, batteries, cables, generators, and other infrastructure), operating expenditure (annual maintenance, labour, and non-fuel running costs), fuel costs (diesel and LNG purchases), and power purchase agreement imports (the cost of electricity imported via the India cable).\n\n::: {#cell-fig-cost-breakdown .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {#fig-cost-breakdown .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div>            <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_SVG\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">if (window.MathJax && window.MathJax.Hub && window.MathJax.Hub.Config) {window.MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: \"STIX-Web\"}});}</script>                <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};</script>\n        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-oy6Be7Eh6eiQFs5M7oXuPxxm9qbJXEtTpfSI93dW16Q=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>                <div id=\"7b7244e0-bd85-4ea6-99b2-98f2b9e9b902\" class=\"plotly-graph-div\" style=\"height:480px; width:100%;\"></div>            <script type=\"text/javascript\">                window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};                                if (document.getElementById(\"7b7244e0-bd85-4ea6-99b2-98f2b9e9b902\")) {                    Plotly.newPlot(                        \"7b7244e0-bd85-4ea6-99b2-98f2b9e9b902\",                        [{\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#3498db\"},\"name\":\"CAPEX\",\"x\":[\"S1 BAU\",\"S2 FI\",\"S3 NG\",\"S4 IG\",\"S5 NS\",\"S6 MR\",\"S7 LNG\"],\"y\":[0.5133098360743283,3.7082150642347256,1.6432917259427688,1.9589627725213345,1.8385331374281586,2.1180032416104693,1.9656502665488178],\"type\":\"bar\"},{\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#2ecc71\"},\"name\":\"OPEX\",\"x\":[\"S1 BAU\",\"S2 FI\",\"S3 NG\",\"S4 IG\",\"S5 NS\",\"S6 MR\",\"S7 LNG\"],\"y\":[0.8861975295689597,1.2281842566698418,0.8323967062239745,0.9008458495989958,0.8369344088131113,0.842911140306321,0.7789285381268954],\"type\":\"bar\"},{\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#e74c3c\"},\"name\":\"Fuel\",\"x\":[\"S1 BAU\",\"S2 FI\",\"S3 NG\",\"S4 IG\",\"S5 NS\",\"S6 MR\",\"S7 LNG\"],\"y\":[14.347724981245465,2.415261392266368,6.471935023209864,7.096449951175424,5.9775258961667666,5.238716951771864,4.831519571504652],\"type\":\"bar\"},{\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#9b59b6\"},\"name\":\"PPA Imports\",\"x\":[\"S1 BAU\",\"S2 FI\",\"S3 NG\",\"S4 IG\",\"S5 NS\",\"S6 MR\",\"S7 LNG\"],\"y\":[0.0,2.105449788550918,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0],\"type\":\"bar\"}],                        {\"template\":{\"layout\":{\"colorway\":[\"#6c757d\",\"#0d6efd\",\"#198754\",\"#0dcaf0\",\"#fd7e14\",\"#ffc107\",\"#6f42c1\"],\"font\":{\"color\":\"#2c3e50\",\"family\":\"Inter, Segoe UI, Helvetica, sans-serif\",\"size\":13},\"legend\":{\"bgcolor\":\"rgba(255,255,255,0.9)\",\"bordercolor\":\"#dee2e6\",\"borderwidth\":1,\"font\":{\"size\":11}},\"margin\":{\"b\":50,\"l\":60,\"r\":30,\"t\":60},\"paper_bgcolor\":\"white\",\"plot_bgcolor\":\"#fafafa\",\"title\":{\"font\":{\"color\":\"#1a1a2e\",\"size\":18},\"x\":0.02,\"xanchor\":\"left\"},\"xaxis\":{\"gridcolor\":\"#e9ecef\",\"linecolor\":\"#dee2e6\",\"zerolinecolor\":\"#dee2e6\"},\"yaxis\":{\"gridcolor\":\"#e9ecef\",\"linecolor\":\"#dee2e6\",\"zerolinecolor\":\"#dee2e6\"}}},\"legend\":{\"orientation\":\"h\",\"yanchor\":\"bottom\",\"y\":1.02,\"xanchor\":\"right\",\"x\":1},\"barmode\":\"stack\",\"title\":{\"text\":\"Present Value of Costs by Component ($B)\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":{\"text\":\"PV of Costs ($ Billions)\"}},\"height\":480},                        {\"responsive\": true}                    ).then(function(){\n                            \nvar gd = document.getElementById('7b7244e0-bd85-4ea6-99b2-98f2b9e9b902');\nvar x = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {{\n        var display = window.getComputedStyle(gd).display;\n        if (!display || display === 'none') {{\n            console.log([gd, 'removed!']);\n            Plotly.purge(gd);\n            observer.disconnect();\n        }}\n}});\n\n// Listen for the removal of the full notebook cells\nvar notebookContainer = gd.closest('#notebook-container');\nif (notebookContainer) {{\n    x.observe(notebookContainer, {childList: true});\n}}\n\n// Listen for the clearing of the current output cell\nvar outputEl = gd.closest('.output');\nif (outputEl) {{\n    x.observe(outputEl, {childList: true});\n}}\n\n                        })                };            </script>        </div>\n```\n\nPresent value of costs by component for each scenario. Fuel costs dominate BAU; CAPEX dominates alternatives but at lower total cost.\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe cost structure reveals a fundamental shift between diesel and renewable pathways. Under business-as-usual, the dominant cost component is fuel, which accounts for $14\\.3 billion or approximately 92 per cent of total lifetime system costs. This reflects the inherent economics of diesel generation: the capital cost of generators is relatively modest, but the ongoing fuel expenditure compounds relentlessly over 30 years, especially as diesel prices escalate and demand grows.\n\nThe renewable scenarios invert this cost structure. Capital expenditure — for solar panels, battery systems, and in some cases submarine cables and LNG terminals — becomes the dominant cost component, while fuel costs shrink dramatically or disappear entirely. The critical insight is that even though the upfront CAPEX of the renewable pathways is higher than the BAU generator replacement cost, the total lifetime system cost is substantially lower because the avoided fuel expenditure far outweighs the additional capital investment. Solar panels and batteries, once installed, generate electricity at near-zero marginal cost for decades, whereas diesel generators require a continuous stream of expensive imported fuel.\n\nThe Full Integration scenario (S2) is unique in exhibiting significant PPA import costs alongside CAPEX, reflecting the ongoing payments for electricity imported through the India cable. While these import costs are far lower than the diesel fuel costs they displace, they represent a continuing outflow that the purely domestic renewable scenarios avoid entirely.\n\n### Why Fuel Costs Remain Substantial Even Under Renewable Scenarios {#sec-fuel-persistence}\n\n\n\nA natural question arises from @fig-cost-breakdown: if all alternative scenarios involve substantial renewable energy investment, why does fuel still constitute between 26 and 73 per cent of total lifetime costs in the domestic scenarios (S3–S7)? The answer lies in a set of binding physical, geographic, and technical constraints that limit the achievable renewable energy penetration on small coral islands.\n\n**Land scarcity.** The most fundamental constraint is that the Maldives has only 134 km² of total inhabited island area, spread across nearly 200 islands. Solar PV requires approximately 7 m² per installed kW (including panel spacing and access), and the model caps the usable share of island area at 15 per cent to preserve land for housing, agriculture, vegetation, and public use. On the smallest and most densely populated islands, solar demand for space exceeds this limit, forcing them into diesel-hybrid configurations regardless of economics. Across all inhabited islands, this physical ceiling means that rooftop and ground-mount solar alone cannot supply the growing national demand.\n\n**The Malé bottleneck.** Greater Malé — comprising Malé, Hulhumalé, and Villimalé — consumes more than half of national electricity but is among the most densely built urban areas in the world. With limited available land, rooftop and commercial installations are capped at approximately 34 MWp, which can supply only about 8 per cent of Malé's demand^[ADB Energy Roadmap 2024–2033 (Table 8): 4 MW ASSURE rooftop + 5 MW additional rooftop + 25 MW commercial rooftop on Gulhifalhu/Thilafushi = 34 MWp total. This is nearly double the earlier ZNES Flensburg estimate of 18 MWp (public buildings and sports facilities only).]. Because Malé's demand share is so large, even if every outer island achieved 100 per cent renewable supply, the national weighted average would be constrained by Malé's limited rooftop potential. The Near-Shore Solar (S5) and Maximum RE (S6) scenarios exist specifically to break this bottleneck by siting 104 MW on uninhabited islands and 195 MW on floating platforms near Malé — which is why S6 achieves the highest final RE share at 60 per cent.\n\n**Deployment speed.** Even where economics and land permit, construction logistics impose a practical ceiling of 80 MW of new solar capacity per year nationally. The ADB Energy Roadmap 2024–2033 identifies a pipeline of 424 MW of planned and potential solar initiatives over five years (approximately 85 MW per year), which the model adopts as the base deployment pace. This reflects the realities of importing equipment to remote atolls, limited port capacity, skilled labour scarcity, and the sequential nature of island-by-island installation. Over the 30 year analysis period, cumulative installations are substantial, but growing demand (at approximately 5 per cent per year) constantly expands the denominator against which the RE share is measured.\n\nNote that the Government of Maldives targets **33 per cent** renewable energy in electricity consumption by 2028 (ADB Energy Roadmap 2024–2033), which requires approximately 800 GWh from renewable sources against projected demand of 2,400 GWh. The model's deployment trajectory is calibrated to this near-term target, and the scenarios explore what happens as the transition continues beyond 2028 toward 2056, with the ultimate RE share determined by the interplay of deployment speed, land constraints, and demand growth.\n\n**Storage duration.** Solar panels produce electricity for roughly six to eight hours per day, concentrated around midday. The model assumes 4 hours of battery storage per site, which covers the evening demand peak but cannot carry load through the entire night. With a maximum depth of discharge of 80 per cent and round-trip efficiency of 88 per cent, the usable energy per cycle is further reduced. Diesel backup therefore remains essential for overnight and extended cloudy-period generation. Increasing storage to eight or more hours would substantially raise RE penetration, but at current battery prices ($350/kWh installed), the cost of doubling storage duration exceeds the fuel savings it would displace.\n\n**The net effect** is that even the most ambitious technically feasible scenario (S6 Maximum RE) reaches only 60 per cent renewable penetration by 2056, while the more conservative pathways (S3, S4) plateau around 51 to 51 per cent. The remaining generation gap — ranging from 40 to 5 per cent — must be filled by diesel (or LNG in S7), and the cumulative fuel cost of that residual fossil generation over 30 years is what produces the large red bars visible in every scenario. This persistent fuel exposure is precisely why the sensitivity analysis (@sec-sensitivity) identifies diesel price as the single most influential parameter across all pathways: even after transition, the Maldives remains partially dependent on imported fuel, and the economic case for transition is strengthened — not weakened — by this reality, because the alternative is *total* dependence under BAU.\n\n## Benefit-Cost Ratios and Returns\n\nThe benefit-cost ratio and internal rate of return provide complementary perspectives on the economic attractiveness of each transition pathway. The BCR indicates the total present value of benefits generated per dollar of incremental cost, with any value above 1.0 indicating that the investment creates net value for society. The IRR identifies the discount rate at which the project breaks even, with values exceeding the 6 per cent hurdle rate confirming economic viability.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-bcr-irr .cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {#fig-bcr-irr .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div>            <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_SVG\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">if (window.MathJax && window.MathJax.Hub && window.MathJax.Hub.Config) {window.MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: \"STIX-Web\"}});}</script>                <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};</script>\n        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-oy6Be7Eh6eiQFs5M7oXuPxxm9qbJXEtTpfSI93dW16Q=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>                <div id=\"127dbd29-4199-42a0-a11e-11a3e083f70b\" class=\"plotly-graph-div\" style=\"height:400px;

The scenarios with the highest BCRs tend to be those that achieve the deepest displacement of diesel fuel, because the avoided fuel costs constitute the largest benefit stream. The LNG scenario (S7) achieves the highest IRR, reflecting its combination of relatively modest CAPEX and rapid, large fuel cost savings from replacing expensive diesel with cheaper gas — even though it does not achieve the highest absolute NPV savings.\n\nThe full results table below consolidates all key metrics for ready comparison across scenarios.\n\n::: {#tbl-results-summary .cell tbl-cap='Full scenario comparison table: costs, savings, returns, emissions.' execution_count=7}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=7}\n| Scenario   | PV Total Costs ($B)   | LCOE ($/kWh)   | NPV Savings ($B)   | BCR   | IRR (%)   | Payback (yr)   |   Emissions (MtCO₂) | Final RE (%)   |\n|:-----------|:----------------------|:---------------|:-------------------|:------|:----------|:---------------|--------------------:|:---------------|\n| S1 BAU     | $15.7                 | $0.437         | —                  | —     | —         | —              |                65.8 | 1%             |\n| S2 FI      | $9.2                  | $0.208         | $10.0              | 2.8×  | 16.1%     | 13             |                46.2 | 11%            |\n| S3 NG      | $8.8                  | $0.280         | $11.0              | 11.2× | 32.5%     | 7              |                31.9 | 51%            |\n| S4 IG      | $9.8                  | $0.312         | $9.9               | 7.8×  | 25.8%     | 8              |                32   | 51%            |\n| S5 NS      | $8.5                  | $0.271         | $11.6              | 10.1× | 31.9%     | 8              |                29.4 | 54%            |\n| S6 MR      | $8.0                  | $0.256         | $12.6              | 9.1×  | 31.7%     | 8              |                25.4 | 60%            |\n| S7 LNG     | $7.4                  | $0.206         | $13.0              | 10.7× | 37.9%     | 7              |                30.6 | 47%            |\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe summary table reinforces the central finding that every alternative pathway is economically superior to continued diesel dependence, and it allows the reader to see the trade-offs among them. The scenarios with the highest renewable energy shares tend to deliver the largest NPV savings, the lowest LCOE, and the deepest emissions reductions, but they may also require more capital and involve greater technological risk (as with floating solar in S6). The LNG scenario stands out for its combination of fast payback and high IRR, which reflects its bridging character — it achieves rapid cost savings by swapping one fossil fuel for a cheaper one, rather than by fundamentally transforming the technology base.\n\n## LCOE Comparison\n\nThe levelised cost of electricity provides the most intuitive metric for comparing generation costs across technologies and scenarios. Unlike total system cost or NPV, which are sensitive to demand projections and discount rates, LCOE expresses the average cost of producing one unit of electricity over the project lifetime, making it directly comparable to retail tariffs, benchmark studies, and international experience.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-lcoe .cell execution_count=8}\n\n::: {#fig-lcoe .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div>            <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_SVG\"></script><script type=\"text/javascript\">if (window.MathJax && window.MathJax.Hub && window.MathJax.Hub.Config) {window.MathJax.Hub.Config({SVG: {font: \"STIX-Web\"}});}</script>                <script type=\"text/javascript\">window.PlotlyConfig = {MathJaxConfig: 'local'};</script>\n        <script charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-3.0.1.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-oy6Be7Eh6eiQFs5M7oXuPxxm9qbJXEtTpfSI93dW16Q=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>                <div id=\"cecccb6f-0c19-4c38-8e6c-9a4f2f2d55e0\" class=\"plotly-graph-div\" style=\"height:450px; width:100%;\"></div>            <script type=\"text/javascript\">                window.PLOTLYENV=window.PLOTLYENV || {};                                if (document.getElementById(\"cecccb6f-0c19-4c38-8e6c-9a4f2f2d55e0\")) {                    Plotly.newPlot(                        \"cecccb6f-0c19-4c38-8e6c-9a4f2f2d55e0\",                        [{\"marker\":{\"color\":[\"#6c757d\",\"#0d6efd\",\"#198754\",\"#0dcaf0\",\"#fd7e14\",\"#ffc107\",\"#6f42c1\"]},\"name\":\"Maldives Scenarios\",\"text\":[\"43.7¢\",\"20.8¢\",\"28.0¢\",\"31.2¢\",\"27.1¢\",\"25.6¢\",\"20.6¢\"],\"textposition\":\"outside\",\"x\":[\"S1 BAU\",\"S2 FI\",\"S3 NG\",\"S4 IG\",\"S5 NS\",\"S6 MR\",\"S7 LNG\"],\"y\":[43.701155604143175,20.821671011630595,28.049940903673452,31.1717454331058,27.086937280570584,25.574563483328127,20.63287829659005],\"type\":\"bar\"}],                        {\"template\":{\"layout\":{\"colorway\":[\"#6c757d\",\"#0d6efd\",\"#198754\",\"#0dcaf0\",\"#fd7e14\",\"#ffc107\",\"#6f42c1\"],\"font\":{\"color\":\"#2c3e50\",\"family\":\"Inter, Segoe UI, Helvetica, sans-serif\",\"size\":13},\"legend\":{\"bgcolor\":\"rgba(255,255,255,0.9)\",\"bordercolor\":\"#dee2e6\",\"borderwidth\":1,\"font\":{\"size\":11}},\"margin\":{\"b\":50,\"l\":60,\"r\":30,\"t\":60},\"paper_bgcolor\":\"white\",\"plot_bgcolor\":\"#fafafa\",\"title\":{\"font\":{\"color\":\"#1a1a2e\",\"size\":18},\"x\":0.02,\"xanchor\":\"left\"},\"xaxis\":{\"gridcolor\":\"#e9ecef\",\"linecolor\":\"#dee2e6\",\"zerolinecolor\":\"#dee2e6\"},\"yaxis\":{\"gridcolor\":\"#e9ecef\",\"linecolor\":\"#dee2e6\",\"zerolinecolor\":\"#dee2e6\"}}},\"shapes\":[{\"line\":{\"color\":\"#27ae60\",\"dash\":\"dot\"},\"type\":\"line\",\"x0\":0,\"x1\":1,\"xref\":\"x domain\",\"y0\":4.9,\"y1\":4.9,\"yref\":\"y\"},{\"line\":{\"color\":\"#f39c12\",\"dash\":\"dot\"},\"type\":\"line\",\"x0\":0,\"x1\":1,\"xref\":\"x domain\",\"y0\":16.0,\"y1\":16.0,\"yref\":\"y\"},{\"line\":{\"color\":\"#e74c3c\",\"dash\":\"dot\"},\"type\":\"line\",\"x0\":0,\"x1\":1,\"xref\":\"x domain\",\"y0\":28.000000000000004,\"y1\":28.000000000000004,\"yref\":\"y\"}],\"annotations\":[{\"showarrow\":false,\"text\":\"IRENA Global Solar\",\"x\":0,\"xanchor\":\"left\",\"xref\":\"x domain\",\"y\":4.9,\"yanchor\":\"bottom\",\"yref\":\"y\"},{\"showarrow\":false,\"text\":\"SIDS Average RE\",\"x\":0,\"xanchor\":\"left\",\"xref\":\"x domain\",\"y\":16.0,\"yanchor\":\"bottom\",\"yref\":\"y\"},{\"showarrow\":false,\"text\":\"Global Diesel Mini-grid\",\"x\":0,\"xanchor\":\"left\",\"xref\":\"x domain\",\"y\":28.000000000000004,\"yanchor\":\"bottom\",\"yref\":\"y\"}],\"title\":{\"text\":\"Levelised Cost of Electricity (¢\\u002fkWh)\"},\"yaxis\":{\"title\":{\"text\":\"LCOE (¢\\u002fkWh)\"}},\"height\":450,\"showlegend\":false},                        {\"responsive\": true}                    ).then(function(){\n                            \nvar gd = document.getElementById('cecccb6f-0c19-4c38-8e6c-9a4f2f2d55e0');\nvar x = new MutationObserver(function (mutations, observer) {{\n        var display = window.getComputedStyle(gd).display;\n        if (!display || display === 'none') {{\n            console.log([gd, 'removed!']);\n            Plotly.purge(gd);\n            observer.disconnect();\n        }}\n}});\n\n// Listen for the removal of the full notebook cells\nvar notebookContainer = gd.closest('#notebook-container');\nif (notebookContainer) {{\n    x.observe(notebookContainer, {childList: true});\n}}\n\n// Listen for the clearing of the current output cell\nvar outputEl = gd.closest('.output');\nif (outputEl) {{\n    x.observe(outputEl, {childList: true});\n}}\n\n                        })                };            </script>        </div>\n```\n\nLevelised cost of electricity by scenario, with international benchmarks for context.\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe LCOE comparison chart places the Maldives scenarios in the context of international benchmarks. The diesel BAU LCOE substantially exceeds global diesel mini-grid averages, reflecting the particular cost penalties of small-island generation: fuel transport surcharges, scale inefficiencies of small generators, and high labour costs for maintenance on remote islands. The renewable-based scenarios achieve LCOEs that approach the SIDS average for renewable generation and, in some cases, come close to global utility-scale solar benchmarks — a remarkable achievement for a small island nation with severe logistical constraints. The gap between the BAU LCOE and the best alternative LCOEs represents the per-unit cost advantage of transition, which compounds into the billions of dollars of NPV savings documented above.\n\n## Emissions Trajectories\n\nClimate impact is a critical dimension of the energy transition decision, both because the Maldives has committed to ambitious emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement and because, as the world's lowest-lying nation, it has an existential stake in global climate action.

All alternatives achieve significant emission reductions versus diesel BAU.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe emissions comparison reveals the enormous environmental dividend of transition. Under diesel BAU, the Maldives electricity sector would emit 65\\.8 million tonnes of CO₂ over the 30-year period. The cleanest scenario, S6 MR, reduces cumulative emissions by 61 per cent to just 25\\.4 million tonnes. Even the scenarios that retain some fossil fuel component — such as the LNG Transition (S7), which achieves a 44 per cent reduction in emission intensity by switching from diesel to natural gas — deliver substantial climate benefits relative to the status quo.\n\nThe emissions ranking does not perfectly mirror the economic ranking, which creates an interesting policy tension. Some scenarios that are slightly less cost-optimal deliver substantially deeper decarbonisation, meaning that policymakers face a genuine choice about how much additional cost (if any) they are willing to accept to achieve greater emissions reduction. However, the trade-off is modest: the cost difference between the most economically efficient scenario and the most environmentally ambitious one is small relative to the savings both deliver versus diesel.\n\n## The India Cable vs. Domestic Alternatives\n\nA question of particular strategic importance is whether the India submarine cable (S2) justifies its substantial cost premium over domestic renewable alternatives. While the cable clearly dominates diesel BAU (as do all alternatives), the relevant policy comparison is against the next-best option that does not require international infrastructure. The incremental analysis comparing S2 (Full Integration) against S3 (National Grid, the best domestic alternative) directly addresses this question.\n\n\n\nThe incremental analysis reveals that the India cable requires $2\\.1B in additional capital expenditure beyond what the National Grid domestic scenario would cost. This additional investment yields an incremental benefit-cost ratio of only 0\\.80, which falls below the 1.0 threshold — meaning that the marginal costs of the cable exceed its marginal benefits relative to domestic solar-plus-battery. The incremental IRR of 1\\.8 per cent is below the 6 per cent social discount rate, and the incremental payback period extends to 22 years, raising questions about the cable's economic justification on the margin.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n## The cable does not pay for itself on the margin\nWhile S2 saves money versus *diesel* (BCR 2\\.8 ×), it does *not* save money versus *domestic solar+battery* (S3). The cable's marginal BCR of 0\\.80 means that every additional dollar invested in the cable yields only 80 cents of additional benefit. Domestic RE is more cost-effective.\n:::\n\nThis finding does not categorically rule out the India cable — there may be strategic, geopolitical, or energy security arguments that fall outside the scope of economic CBA. However, it does establish that from a pure cost-effectiveness standpoint, the Maldives would be better served by investing the same capital in domestic solar, battery, and near-shore solar capacity. The cable's marginal economics would improve if India were to share the construction cost (the sensitivity analysis explores a 50 per cent cost-sharing scenario), if Indian electricity export prices were lower than assumed, or if domestic solar deployment encountered unforeseen cost escalation. These conditions are possible but uncertain, which reinforces the real-options argument for deferring the cable decision presented in @sec-real-options.\n\n",
