Populations range from 50 to 250,000, each island running its own power system.\n:::\n\n## The Maldives Energy Story {#sec-energy-story}\n\n\n\nThe Maldives electricity sector runs almost entirely on imported diesel. As of 2024, roughly 93 per cent of electricity is diesel-generated^[@gom_roadmap2024; confirmed by @reglobal2023 and STELCO operational data.], from a fleet of about 532 MW spread across individual powerhouses throughout the archipelago. Installed solar PV capacity stands at only 68 MW, contributing roughly 6 per cent of generation. With average global horizontal irradiance of approximately 5.4 kWh/m²/day^[@gsa2023_atlas.], the Maldives is among the best-resourced countries in South Asia for solar energy, making this low deployment striking.\n\nGeographic fragmentation compounds the cost problem. No national grid connects the islands, and no inter-island submarine cables are in operation. Each inhabited island runs its own generation and distribution system, typically consisting of a diesel powerhouse, a low-voltage network, and sometimes a small solar array with limited battery backup. System sizes range from a single 50 kW generator on the smallest atolls to the Greater Malé network with over 140 MW serving a quarter of a million people^[@maldives_iedb2018; STELCO Annual Report.]. In practice, the Maldives faces not one transition challenge but 187 separate ones.\n\nElectricity provision is expensive. Outer-island generation costs fall in the range of $0.30–$0.70 per kWh^[@adb_assure2023; @maldives_srep.], driven by small generator inefficiency and high fuel transport costs. The government subsidises retail tariffs at about $0.15/kWh to maintain affordability^[@gom_roadmap2024; the Roadmap reports over $200 million in annual electricity subsidies.], creating a fiscal burden that grows with demand.\n\n## Why a Transition Is Urgent {#sec-urgency}\n\n\n\nThe economic case, the environmental imperative, and recent technology cost declines all point toward transition now.\n\n**Economic pressure.** At growth rates of about 5 per cent per year, diesel fuel expenditures would absorb an estimated **$14\\.4 billion** in present value over 2026–2056. The 2022 energy price shock illustrated this exposure: generation costs spiked, subsidy bills surged, and the fiscal position deteriorated.\n\n**Climate imperative.** The Maldives is the world’s lowest-lying nation, averaging about 1.5 metres above sea level^[@maldives_ndc2020.]. Under business-as-usual, the electricity sector alone would emit 65\\.8 million tonnes of CO₂ over the analysis period. These emissions are small in global terms but difficult to reconcile with the country’s founding membership of AOSIS and its Paris Agreement commitments, including a 26% conditional emissions reduction by 2030^[@maldives_ndc2020.].\n\n**Technology opportunity.** Solar PV costs have fallen by roughly 90% since 2010^[@irena_costs2024.], and lithium-ion battery costs have followed a similar trajectory^[@bnef_battery2025.]. Renewable energy is now cost-competitive with diesel on small, isolated islands without subsidy. The remaining decisions concern which pathway to pursue, how fast to move, and how to finance the upfront capital.\n\n## Alignment with the National Energy Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}\n\nThe **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024] targets 33% RE by 2028, identifies 490 MW solar potential, and estimates $1.3B investment across 15 flagship interventions. The seven scenarios in this CBA provide the economic evidence base to assess and prioritise those interventions.\n\n## Purpose of This Analysis {#sec-purpose}\n\nThis report applies standard cost-benefit analysis methodology following @adb_guidelines2017 and @boardman2018 to evaluate seven electricity transition pathways for the Maldives.\n\nThe framework covers a 30 -year horizon from 2026 to 2056, using a 6 per cent real social discount rate (ADB practice for SIDS). Seven scenarios span the technology spectrum from continued diesel through domestic solar-plus-battery, inter-island grids, a submarine cable from India, near-shore and floating solar, wind energy, and LNG. Beyond direct financial costs, the analysis incorporates key externalities: carbon emissions valued at the US EPA Social Cost of Carbon^[@epa_scc2023.], health damages from diesel combustion at $40 per MWh following @parry2014, and environmental externalities (noise, fuel spill risk, biodiversity) at $10 per MWh^[Conservative aggregate: noise $5/MWh, fuel spill risk $3/MWh, biodiversity $2/MWh.].\n\nRobustness testing includes 48-parameter Monte Carlo simulation (1\\,000 iterations with Iman-Conover rank correlations), one-way sensitivity analysis, switching-value analysis, multi-horizon comparison (20, 30, 50 years), and declining discount rate sensitivity following @hm_treasury2022, @weitzman2001, and @drupp2018.\n\nTwo extensions complement the CBA. A distributional analysis draws on 4,817 household records from @hies2019 to examine how costs and benefits fall across income quintiles, gender, and geography. A multi-criteria analysis scores scenarios on eight criteria under five weight profiles, covering non-monetisable dimensions such as implementation feasibility and climate resilience.\n\n## Geographic Context {#sec-geography}\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The Maldives archipelago spans 900 km north-south across 26 atolls. Each inhabited island operates an independent power system. Greater Malé (inset) concentrates 43% of the population and 57% of electricity demand.](01-introduction_files/figure-pdf/fig-geography-output-1.png){#fig-geography}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe 26 atolls stretch across nearly 900 km, from Haa Alif in the north to Addu in the south. Many outer islands are separated from their nearest neighbours by 10–50 km of open ocean.\n\n\n\nElectricity demand is concentrated unevenly. Greater Malé — Malé, Hulhumalé, and Villimalé — holds about 43 per cent of the population^[@maldives_census2022.] and 57 per cent of electricity demand^[@maldives_iedb2018.], served by STELCO’s power station network (>100 MW installed). The remaining 57 per cent of the population, spread across 176 outer islands, accounts for 43 per cent of demand but relies on isolated diesel micro-grids that are individually small and expensive to maintain. A separate segment — over 170 privately operated resort islands — consumes an estimated 1,050 GWh/year of diesel-generated electricity^[Derived from resort capacity data and typical load factors; @gom_roadmap2024.] but operates off-grid and outside the scope of this public utility analysis.\n\nThis geography determines the structure of every scenario. Solutions for Greater Malé (submarine cables, LNG, near-shore solar) differ fundamentally from outer-island solutions (rooftop and ground-mounted solar with battery storage, deployed island by island). A credible strategy must address both.\n\n## Report Structure\n\n**Main chapters:** @sec-methodology (framework), @sec-scenarios (seven pathways), @sec-results (costs, LCOE, emissions), @sec-sensitivity (robustness tests), @sec-mca (multi-criteria), @sec-distributional (equity), @sec-financing (investment), @sec-implementation (roadmap), @sec-conclusions.\n\n**Appendices:** [A](A-methodology-detail.qmd) (model specification), [B](B-parameters.qmd) (parameters & sources), [C](C-supplementary.qmd) (learning curves, climate scenarios, transport, real options, benchmarks).\n\n",
