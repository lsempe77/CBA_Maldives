This unique geography creates an energy challenge unlike any other: every kilowatt-hour of electricity must be generated on-site from imported diesel fuel, shipped to individual islands, and consumed within isolated micro-grids that serve populations ranging from 50 to 250,000 people.\n:::\n\n## The Maldives Energy Story {#sec-energy-story}\n\n\n\nThe Maldives electricity sector is defined by several structural features that together create an energy system unlike any other in the world. The most fundamental of these is the country's near-total dependence on imported diesel fuel. As of 2024, approximately 93 per cent of the nation's electricity comes from diesel generators^[@gom_roadmap2024; confirmed by @reglobal2023 and STELCO operational data.] — a fleet of roughly 532 MW spread across hundreds of individual powerhouses on islands throughout the archipelago. Only 68 MW of solar PV capacity has been installed to date, producing roughly 6 per cent of total generation. This level of diesel dependence is among the highest in the world and stands in stark contrast to the country's exceptional solar resource, which delivers average global horizontal irradiance of approximately 5.4 kWh/m²/day^[@gsa2023_atlas.] — among the best in South Asia.\n\nThe second defining characteristic is the extreme geographic fragmentation of the power system. There is no national grid connecting the islands, nor are there any inter-island submarine cables currently in operation. Each inhabited island operates its own self-contained generation and distribution system, typically consisting of a diesel powerhouse, a low-voltage distribution network, and in some cases a small solar array with limited battery backup. The capacity of these isolated systems varies enormously: the smallest outer islands may rely on a single 50 kW diesel generator serving fewer than 100 households, while the Greater Malé region operates a sophisticated 140 MW power station network serving a quarter of a million people^[@maldives_iedb2018; STELCO Annual Report.]. This fragmentation means that the Maldives does not face a single energy transition challenge but rather 187 separate ones, each with its own demand profile, cost structure, and technical constraints.\n\nThe third structural feature is the high and rising cost of electricity provision. Outer-island generation costs range from $0.30 to $0.70 per kWh^[@adb_assure2023; @maldives_srep.], driven by the inefficiency of small diesel generators, high fuel transport costs to remote islands, and the lack of scale economies. The Government of Maldives subsidises retail electricity tariffs at approximately $0.15 per kWh to maintain affordability^[@gom_roadmap2024; the Roadmap reports over $200 million in annual electricity subsidies.], creating a fiscal burden that grows in step with demand. This subsidy represents a substantial and recurring drain on the national budget, crowding out other public investment priorities while simultaneously insulating consumers from price signals that might encourage conservation and efficiency.\n\n## Why a Transition Is Urgent {#sec-urgency}\n\n\n\nThree converging pressures make energy transition a first-order policy priority for the Maldives, and the analysis presented in this report demonstrates that the window for action is both wide open and time-sensitive.\n\nThe first and most immediate pressure is economic. At current growth rates of approximately 5 per cent per year, diesel fuel expenditures will absorb an estimated **$14\\.3 billion** in present value over the 2026–2056 analysis period. This represents a massive and sustained outflow of national wealth to international petroleum markets, leaving the Maldives chronically exposed to the volatility of global oil prices. The 2022 energy price shock, driven by geopolitical events far beyond the country's control, offered a vivid preview of this vulnerability: electricity generation costs spiked, the government subsidy bill surged, and the fiscal position deteriorated sharply. Every dollar spent on imported fuel is a dollar not invested in education, healthcare, climate adaptation infrastructure, or other development priorities that could build long-term resilience and prosperity.\n\nThe second pressure is the climate imperative. The Maldives is the world's lowest-lying nation, with an average elevation of approximately 1.5 metres and a highest natural point barely two metres above sea level^[@maldives_ndc2020.]. It is existentially threatened by sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and intensifying tropical weather events — all consequences of the very fossil fuel combustion that powers its economy. Under the business-as-usual pathway, the Maldivian electricity sector alone would emit 65\\.8 million tonnes of CO₂ over the analysis period. While these emissions are globally modest, they are symbolically and morally significant for a nation that has positioned itself as a leader in international climate advocacy. As a founding member of the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and a signatory to the Paris Agreement, the Maldives has committed to ambitious emissions reduction targets — including a 26 per cent conditional reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 under its updated NDC^[@maldives_ndc2020.] — that cannot be met without a fundamental transformation of its power sector.\n\nThe third pressure is the technological opportunity that has emerged over the past decade. Solar photovoltaic costs have fallen by approximately 90 per cent since 2010^[@irena_costs2024.], and lithium-ion battery costs have followed a similar trajectory^[@bnef_battery2025.]. For the first time in the history of electrification, renewable energy technologies are cost-competitive with diesel generation even on small, isolated islands — without requiring any subsidy. This technological revolution means that the Maldives no longer faces a trade-off between economic development and environmental responsibility: the cheapest pathway forward is also the cleanest. The question confronting policymakers is therefore not whether to transition, but how fast, by which route, and with what institutional and financing arrangements.\n\n## Alignment with the National Energy Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}\n\nThe Government of Maldives has recognised this imperative. The **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024], prepared with Asian Development Bank technical support and launched at COP29, sets out a comprehensive national strategy for energy transition. The Roadmap targets 33 per cent renewable energy by 2028 (reflecting the Maldives' COP28 commitment), identifies 490 MW of solar deployment potential, estimates $1.3 billion in required investment, and outlines 15 flagship interventions spanning utility-scale solar, battery storage, grid modernisation, and institutional reform. This analysis is fully aligned with the Roadmap's strategic direction. The seven scenarios evaluated in this report provide the rigorous cost-benefit evidence base needed to assess the Roadmap's interventions, to compare alternative implementation pathways, and to quantify the long-term economic returns of pursuing the Roadmap's targets at different scales and speeds.\n\n## Purpose of This Analysis {#sec-purpose}\n\nThis report applies standard cost-benefit analysis methodology — consistent with @adb_guidelines2017 and @boardman2018 — to evaluate seven electricity transition pathways for the Maldives. The analysis is designed to provide decision-makers with a rigorous, transparent, and comprehensive evidence base for comparing fundamentally different energy strategies.\n\nThe analytical framework evaluates each scenario over a 30 -year time horizon from 2026 to 2056, applying a 6 per cent real social discount rate consistent with Asian Development Bank practice for small island developing states. Seven scenarios are assessed, spanning the full technology spectrum from continued diesel dependence through domestic solar-plus-battery systems, inter-island grid connections, submarine cable imports from India, near-shore and floating solar farms, and liquefied natural gas. Beyond direct financial costs and benefits, the analysis incorporates key externalities that a purely private-sector investment appraisal would ignore: carbon emissions are valued using the US EPA Social Cost of Carbon^[@epa_scc2023.], health damages from diesel combustion-related air pollution are monetised at $40 per MWh following @parry2014, and environmental externalities including noise pollution, fuel spill risk, and biodiversity impacts are included at $10 per MWh^[Conservative aggregate estimate from the environmental economics literature; individual components: noise $5/MWh, fuel spill risk $3/MWh, biodiversity impacts $2/MWh.].\n\nThe robustness of the findings is tested through an unusually comprehensive suite of sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. A 39-parameter Monte Carlo simulation runs 1\\,000 iterations with Iman-Conover rank correlations to propagate parametric uncertainty through the entire model. One-way sensitivity analysis identifies the parameters to which results are most sensitive, while switching-value analysis determines how far each parameter must change to reverse the scenario ranking. Multi-horizon analysis (20, 30, and 50 years) and declining discount rate sensitivity (following @hm_treasury2022 methodology, supported by @weitzman2001 and @drupp2018) test the stability of findings across alternative analytical frameworks.\n\nThe report also extends beyond traditional CBA in two important directions. A distributional analysis, drawing on 4,817 household records from the @hies2019, examines how the costs and benefits of transition are distributed across income quintiles, gender, and geography — addressing the equity dimension that aggregate efficiency metrics cannot capture. A multi-criteria analysis evaluates scenarios across eight criteria with five alternative weight profiles, providing a framework for incorporating non-monetisable considerations such as implementation feasibility, social equity, and climate resilience.\n\n## Geographic Context {#sec-geography}\n\n::: {#fig-geography .cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {#fig-geography-1 .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): text/html\n```\n\nThe Maldives archipelago spans 900 km north-south across 26 atolls. Each inhabited island operates an independent power system. Greater Malé (inset) concentrates 43% of the population and 57% of electricity demand.\n:::\n\n::: {#fig-geography-2 .cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): text/html\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe map above illustrates the extraordinary geographic challenge confronting Maldivian energy planners. The 26 atolls of the archipelago stretch across nearly 900 kilometres of the Indian Ocean, from Haa Alif in the north to Addu in the south. Each dot represents an inhabited island, with the size of the marker proportional to population. The clustering around Greater Malé is immediately apparent, as is the wide dispersion of the outer islands, many of which are separated from their nearest neighbours by 10 to 50 kilometres of open ocean.\n\n\n\nThe geographic distribution of electricity demand is profoundly unequal, and this inequality is the central challenge in designing an effective transition strategy. Greater Malé — comprising the islands of Malé, Hulhumalé, and Villimalé — concentrates approximately 43 per cent of the national population^[@maldives_census2022.] and 57 per cent of total electricity demand^[@maldives_iedb2018.], served by STELCO's centralised power station network with installed capacity exceeding 100 MW. The remaining 57 per cent of the population is distributed across 176 inhabited outer islands, accounting for 43 per cent of national demand but served by isolated diesel micro-grids that are individually small, expensive to operate, and difficult to maintain. A third important component of the energy landscape — the 170-plus privately operated resort islands — consumes an estimated 1,050 GWh per year of diesel-generated electricity^[@gom_roadmap2024; derived from resort capacity data and typical load factors.] but operates entirely off-grid and outside the scope of the public utility cost-benefit analysis presented here.\n\nThis three-way division shapes every scenario evaluated in this report. Solutions appropriate for Greater Malé — submarine cables, large-scale LNG terminals, near-shore solar farms on reclaimed or uninhabited islands — are fundamentally different in scale, technology, and institutional requirements from solutions for the outer islands, where rooftop and ground-mounted solar panels with battery storage deployed on each individual island represent the most practical and cost-effective approach. Any credible transition strategy must therefore address both segments simultaneously, recognising that a one-size-fits-all approach cannot work in such a geographically fragmented system.\n\n## Report Structure\n\nThis report is organised to guide the reader from analytical framework through findings to policy recommendations. @sec-methodology presents the cost-benefit analysis framework and key assumptions, explaining how costs, benefits, and externalities are quantified and discounted. @sec-scenarios describes each of the seven pathways in detail, including their technology mixes, implementation timelines, and underlying assumptions. @sec-results presents the core economic findings, comparing scenarios on cost, LCOE, emissions, and economic return metrics. @sec-sensitivity tests the robustness of these findings through comprehensive sensitivity, Monte Carlo, switching-value, and multi-horizon analyses. @sec-mca provides the multi-criteria analysis, extending the evaluation beyond economic efficiency to encompass environmental, social, and institutional dimensions. @sec-distributional examines the equity implications of transition, using household survey data to assess who bears the costs and who captures the benefits. @sec-financing assesses the investment requirements and available concessional financing structures. @sec-implementation outlines a phased implementation roadmap with key decision points and risk mitigation strategies. @sec-conclusions synthesises the findings into actionable policy recommendations.\n\nFor readers seeking technical detail, the full mathematical specification of the model is presented in [Appendix A](A-methodology-detail.qmd), complete parameter documentation with sources and sensitivity ranges is in [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd), and supplementary analyses covering endogenous learning curves, climate damage scenarios, transport electrification, real options theory, and international benchmarking are in [Appendix C](C-supplementary.qmd).\n\n",
