The recommended approach borrows from several: deploy irreversible, high-certainty investments immediately (outer-island solar-battery, S4) and near-shore solar for Greater Malé (S5), while deferring the large, lumpy commitments (LNG terminal, India cable) until uncertainty has narrowed.\n:::\n\n## Phased Strategy\n\nThe strategy synthesises elements from multiple pathways to capture early fuel savings while preserving flexibility on larger commitments. Phasing reflects the Maldives’ absorptive capacity, constrained by construction-sector throughput, port logistics, and institutional bandwidth.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Recommended phased implementation timeline. Colours indicate technology type; height indicates investment magnitude.](09-implementation_files/figure-pdf/fig-roadmap-output-1.png){#fig-roadmap}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-roadmap shows investment phasing by technology. Front-loading solar/battery captures immediate fuel savings and builds institutional experience; larger, uncertain investments (cable) are deferred for better information.\n\n## Phase 1: Quick Wins (2026–2028)\n\nSolar-battery deployment on ~170 outer islands where LCOE is roughly half that of diesel. The target is 80 MW/yr, starting with islands where the cost advantage is largest.\n\nIn parallel: initiate EIAs for near-shore solar sites (Thilafushi, Gulhifalhu; 18–24 months typical)^[EPA guidelines.] and commission LNG terminal feasibility studies. These planning activities create option value for later phases.\n\n## Phase 2: Scale-Up (2029–2032)\n\nFocus shifts to Greater Malé. ~104 MW of near-shore solar farms on uninhabited islands near the capital serve the population centre (~50% of demand).\n\nIf feasibility studies support it: 140 MW LNG at Gulhifalhu as a bridge fuel. This implies a 30-year fuel lock-in — proceed only if RE alone cannot meet baseload with acceptable reliability.\n\nRemaining outer-island solar-battery completes during this phase. Monitoring of India cable technology continues, preserving the option for Phase 3.\n\n## Phase 3: Optimisation (2033–2040)\n\nIf floating solar has matured sufficiently: up to 195 MW floating solar + 80 MW wind, dramatically expanding RE beyond land-constrained islands.\n\nCritical India cable go/no-go ~2035. By then: decade of RE operational experience, updated cable cost projections, clearer geopolitical signals. The real options analysis (@sec-real-options) shows that waiting value exceeds deferral cost.\n\nBattery replacement for Phase 1 systems (15-year lifetime^[@bnef_battery2025.]) commences 2041–43. Plan from 2033; anticipate 18%/doubling cost reductions (Wright's Law)^[@irena_costs2024.]. Target full cost recovery by 2040 with targeted social protection (@sec-distributional).\n\n## Phase 4: Maturation (2041–2056)\n\nMaintenance, replacement cycles, adaptive management. Solar degradation (~0\\.5%/yr^[@jordan2013.]) means 7–15% capacity loss by this period; replacement decisions depend on prevailing costs.\n\nDemand-side management (smart grid, ToU pricing, efficiency standards) moderates growth and aligns consumption with solar profiles. If demand exceeds projections, deploy additional capacity or second cable/LNG as warranted.\n\n## Key Decision Points\n\nThe roadmap centres on discrete decision points, deferring irreversible commitments until evidence is sufficient.\n\n::: {#tbl-decision-points .cell tbl-cap='Critical decision points and their dependencies.' execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display .cell-output-markdown execution_count=3}\n|   Year | Decision                        | Key Dependency                                          | Reversibility                  |\n|-------:|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|\n|   2026 | Solar deployment ramp rate      | ADB/MDB financing commitment                            | Low cost to adjust             |\n|   2027 | Near-shore solar site selection | EIA completion; land tenure                             | Moderate — site-specific       |\n|   2028 | LNG terminal commitment         | Gulhifalhu infrastructure readiness                     | High — 30yr fuel lock-in       |\n|   2030 | India cable feasibility study   | Bilateral agreement status                              | Low — study only               |\n|   2032 | Floating solar pilot            | Technology maturity; marine permits                     | Moderate                       |\n|   2031 | Wind energy deployment          | ADB Roadmap site studies; turbine procurement           | Moderate — phased over 3 years |\n|   2035 | India cable go/no-go            | Cable cost trends; domestic RE performance; geopolitics | Very high — $4.5B+ commitment  |\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@tbl-decision-points shows progressive escalation of commitment. Early decisions (2026 solar ramp) are highly adjustable; later decisions (2028 LNG, 2035 cable) are effectively irreversible. The reversibility column is a heuristic: low = proceed and adapt; very high = defer until evidence is strong.\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Solar/wind/battery cost increase | Low | Moderate | Locked-in via PPA; learning curves favour decline |\n| Diesel price spike | Medium | High | Accelerates transition ROI; increases BAU costs |\n| India cable outage | Medium (λ=0\\.15/yr)^a^ | Very high | Maintain 20% diesel backup; diversified supply |\n| Floating solar technology failure | Medium | Moderate | Defer commitment; pilot first; fallback to conventional |\n| Climate damage to infrastructure | Medium | High | 7\\.5% adaptation premium in CAPEX^b^; resilient design |\n| Financing unavailability | Low | Very high | Multiple MDB pipelines; grant element 82\\.8% with ADB SIDS terms^c^ |\n| Subsidy reform political resistance | High | Moderate | Gradual phase-out 2030–2040; targeted protection for low-income |\n\n^a^ Based on NorNed and Basslink operational records; see @sec-s2. ^b^ @gca2025; 5–15% range. ^c^ @adb_lending2026.\n\nThe risks with the largest potential consequences (financing shortfall, cable outage) are also the least likely. The most probable risk (political resistance to subsidy reform) has manageable impact. A diesel price spike would actually *strengthen* the transition case. Climate damage warrants particular attention given the Maldives’ extreme physical vulnerability; distributed RE pathways (S4–S6) are inherently more resilient to localised damage than centralised alternatives.\n\n",
