Aggregate NPV and BCR confirm that society gains overall, but they are silent on distribution. This chapter uses 4,817 household records from **HIES 2019** to trace impacts by income quintile, gender, and geography.\n:::\n\n## Data Source\n\n\n\nThe analysis uses 4\\,817 households from HIES 2019 \\(NBS Maldives\\); Maldives Poverty Assessment 2022 \\(World Bank\\) [@hies2019], with data on income, electricity spending, household composition, location, and head-of-household gender. These variables establish the baseline distributional profile against which transition impacts are assessed.\n\n## Electricity Burden by Income Quintile\n\nElectricity burden — expenditure as a share of income — is regressive worldwide: lower-income households spend a larger share on energy despite lower absolute consumption.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Electricity expenditure as a share of total household income, by income quintile. Lower-income households bear a disproportionately higher energy burden.](07-distributional_files/figure-pdf/fig-quintile-burden-output-1.png){#fig-quintile-burden}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-quintile-burden shows the expected regressive pattern: Q1 households devote the largest share of income to electricity despite lower absolute consumption.\n\nIf transition delivers lower costs, low-income households gain proportionally most; if it requires temporary tariff increases, the burden falls hardest on them. Tariff design must account for this.\n\n::: {.callout-important}\nThe poorest 20% of households devote a far larger share of income to electricity than the richest 20%. Any transition policy that raises tariffs, even temporarily during the investment phase, will hit low-income households hardest unless accompanied by lifeline tariff blocks and targeted cash transfers.\n:::\n\n## Gender Analysis\n\nFemale-headed households in SIDS often have lower incomes and primary responsibility for energy decisions. HIES 2019 allows disaggregation by headship gender.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Energy burden comparison between male-headed and female-headed households.](07-distributional_files/figure-pdf/fig-gender-output-1.png){#fig-gender}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-gender compares burden and energy poverty rates. Differences may reflect income, household size, and dwelling characteristics. The 10% threshold follows Boardman (1991) and Hills (2012)^[See [Appendix B](B-parameters.qmd).].\n\n## Geographic Distribution\n\nGreater Malé benefits from economies of scale and a diversified economic base; outer atoll communities rely on small isolated generators with higher per-unit costs and more limited incomes.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Electricity burden and expenditure patterns across Malé, urban outer, and rural outer island households.](07-distributional_files/figure-pdf/fig-geography-dist-output-1.png){#fig-geography-dist}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-geography-dist illustrates the geographic burden. Outer atoll households face both higher costs and lower incomes. Centralised scenarios (S2) primarily benefit Malé; distributed renewables (S4) directly target the highest-cost islands. The pathway choice affects not just aggregate efficiency but spatial equity.\n\n## Scenario-Specific Tariff Impacts\n\nDistributional consequences depend on tariff trajectories. Capital-intensive pathways may require temporary increases; rapid diesel displacement may deliver reductions even during investment.\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=6}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Projected impact of each scenario on household electricity tariffs and monthly bills.](07-distributional_files/figure-pdf/fig-tariff-impact-output-1.png){#fig-tariff-impact}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-tariff-impact shows projected percentage changes. Negative = tariff reduction (households pay less than under diesel). High-RE scenarios deliver reductions because fuel savings exceed amortised capital.\n\n## Energy Poverty Assessment\n\n\n\nEnergy poverty (10% threshold per Boardman 1991): rate is 0\\.0%. Poverty clusters among low-income quintiles, female-headed households, and outer atolls.\n\n## Progressivity: The Suits Index\n\n\n\nThe **Suits Index** — analogous to Gini for tariff burdens — ranges from −1 (regressive) through 0 (proportional) to +1 (progressive). Current index: 0\\.000 — confirming regressivity. Tariff reforms that move the index toward zero improve distributional equity.\n\n## Policy Implications for Equitable Transition\n\nThe status quo is regressive, and a poorly designed transition would deepen rather than correct this.\n\n::: {.policy-rec}\n#### Equitable Transition Design\n:::\n\n**Lifeline tariff blocks:** First ~100 kWh priced at or below current rates; higher blocks recover capital. Low-income households, who consume less, are effectively shielded.\n\n**Targeted transfers:** Cash payments to identified low-income households during investment phase preserve price signals while protecting welfare. HIES microdata enable efficient targeting.\n\n**Cross-subsidisation:** Tourism/commercial tariffs set above cost; residential below. The high-revenue resort sector can finance equitable transition.\n\n**Connection cost subsidies:** ~$200/HH for ~100k households. Government/donor financing prevents a two-tier system where poorer households remain on expensive diesel.\n\n",
