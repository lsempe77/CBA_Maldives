## C.1 Endogenous Learning Curves (P6) {#sec-learning}

The main CBA uses exogenous cost declines (fixed %/yr). This section tests endogenous **Wright's Law** [@wright1936] learning: costs decline by a predictable percentage each time cumulative production doubles. Does the Maldives' deployment volume meaningfully influence cost trajectories?

```{python}
#| label: fig-learning-trajectory
#| fig-cap: "Solar PV cost trajectory: exogenous vs. endogenous (Wright's Law)"

trajectory = learning_curves.get("trajectory", [])

if trajectory:
    # trajectory is a list of dicts per year
    years = [int(t["year"]) for t in trajectory]
    exo_solar = [t["solar_exog_usd_kw"] for t in trajectory]
    endo_solar = [t["solar_endog_usd_kw"] for t in trajectory]
    
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years, y=exo_solar,
        mode="lines", name="Exogenous (fixed %/yr)",
        line=dict(color="#6c757d", width=2, dash="dash"),
    ))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years, y=endo_solar,
        mode="lines", name="Endogenous (Wright's Law)",
        line=dict(color="#198754", width=3),
    ))
    fig.update_layout(
        title="Solar PV CAPEX Trajectory ($/kW)",
        xaxis_title="Year",
        yaxis_title="CAPEX ($/kW)",
        height=400,
    )
    fig.show()
```

```{python}
#| label: learning-params
lr_solar = learning_curves.get("solar_learning_rate", 0.20)
lr_batt = learning_curves.get("battery_learning_rate", 0.18)
cum_savings = learning_curves.get("cumulative_savings", {})
```

**Learning rates:** Solar PV `{python} f"{lr_solar*100:.0f}"`% and battery `{python} f"{lr_batt*100:.0f}"`% cost reduction per doubling of cumulative installed capacity, consistent with IRENA (2024) and BNEF (2025) global learning rate estimates.

@fig-learning-trajectory and @fig-learning-battery compare the exogenous and endogenous cost trajectories. The dashed grey line represents the main CBA’s assumption of a fixed annual cost decline; the solid coloured line traces what Wright’s Law predicts based on cumulative deployment. Because the Maldives is a small market (a tiny fraction of global cumulative deployment), endogenous costs are actually *higher* than exogenous projections in the near term. Global learning is driven overwhelmingly by deployment in China, India, the United States, and Europe; the Maldives’ hundreds of megawatts are a rounding error in a market deploying hundreds of gigawatts per year.

However, the policy implication is unchanged: early deployment in the Maldives locks in the benefits of global learning by allowing the country to procure subsequent phases at costs that have been driven down by others' deployment. The Maldives is a price-taker in global solar and battery markets, and delaying deployment merely delays access to these falling costs without influencing the learning trajectory.

```{python}
#| label: fig-learning-battery
#| fig-cap: "Battery cost trajectory: exogenous vs. endogenous"

if trajectory:
    exo_batt = [t["battery_exog_usd_kwh"] for t in trajectory]
    endo_batt = [t["battery_endog_usd_kwh"] for t in trajectory]
    
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years, y=exo_batt,
        mode="lines", name="Exogenous (fixed %/yr)",
        line=dict(color="#6c757d", width=2, dash="dash"),
    ))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years, y=endo_batt,
        mode="lines", name="Endogenous (Wright's Law)",
        line=dict(color="#0d6efd", width=3),
    ))

        xaxis_title="Year",
        yaxis_title="CAPEX ($/kWh)",
        height=400,
    )
    fig.show()
```

## C.2 Climate Damage Scenarios (P7) {#sec-climate}

Solar photovoltaic generation depends on two climate-sensitive variables: global horizontal irradiance (GHI), which determines how much sunlight reaches the panels, and ambient temperature, which affects cell efficiency through temperature derating. Climate change affects both variables, reducing irradiance and raising temperatures — both reducing output.

```{python}
#| label: climate-params
baseline_ghi = climate_scenarios.get("baseline_ghi", 0)
rcp45 = climate_scenarios.get("rcp45", {})
rcp85 = climate_scenarios.get("rcp85", {})
cum_loss_45 = climate_scenarios.get("cumulative_loss_rcp45_pct", -0.4)
cum_loss_85 = climate_scenarios.get("cumulative_loss_rcp85_pct", -0.8)
```

**Scenarios modelled:**

| Pathway | GHI Change by 2050 | Temperature Increase | Solar Output Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | No change | +0.5°C (trend) | Reference |
| RCP 4.5 | `{python} f"{rcp45.get('ghi_change', -0.02)*100:.0f}"`% | `{python} f"+{rcp45.get('temp_rise', 1.5):.1f}"`°C | `{python} f"{cum_loss_45:.1f}"`% cumulative |
| RCP 8.5 | `{python} f"{rcp85.get('ghi_change', -0.05)*100:.0f}"`% | `{python} f"+{rcp85.get('temp_rise', 3.0):.1f}"`°C | `{python} f"{cum_loss_85:.1f}"`% cumulative |

```{python}
#| label: fig-climate-trajectory
#| fig-cap: "Solar generation under climate scenarios"

traj = climate_scenarios.get("trajectory", [])
if traj:
    years_c = [int(t["year"]) for t in traj]
    baseline = [t["generation_baseline_gwh"] for t in traj]
    rcp45_gwh = [t["generation_rcp45_gwh"] for t in traj]
    rcp85_gwh = [t["generation_rcp85_gwh"] for t in traj]
    
    fig = go.Figure()
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years_c, y=baseline,
        mode="lines", name="Baseline",
        line=dict(color="#198754", width=2),
    ))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years_c, y=rcp45_gwh,
        mode="lines", name="RCP 4.5",
        line=dict(color="#fd7e14", width=2),
    ))
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=years_c, y=rcp85_gwh,
        mode="lines", name="RCP 8.5",
        line=dict(color="#dc3545", width=2, dash="dash"),
    ))
    fig.update_layout(
        title="Solar Generation under Climate Scenarios",
        xaxis_title="Year",
        yaxis_title="Generation (GWh)",
        height=400,
    )
    fig.show()
```

@fig-climate-trajectory shows the solar generation trajectories under the three climate scenarios. The baseline (green) represents generation without climate change impacts beyond the temperature derating already embedded in the main model. RCP 4.5 (orange) represents a moderate climate pathway with global warming held to approximately two degrees Celsius by 2100, while RCP 8.5 (red, dashed) represents a high-emissions pathway with much greater warming.

Solar energy proves robust to climate change. Even under the pessimistic RCP 8.5 scenario, the cumulative generation loss over thirty years is less than one percent. The 7.5% climate adaptation premium embedded in CAPEX estimates across the main CBA more than compensates for any climate-driven output reduction.

## C.3 Transport Electrification (P8) {#sec-transport}

This supplementary module analyses land transport electrification. Transport is treated separately because it depends on vehicle fleet turnover, consumer adoption, and fuel pricing decisions largely independent of the utility sector. Nevertheless, the synergy is significant: EVs charged from a decarbonised grid deliver both transport emissions reductions and demand growth that improves RE asset utilisation.

```{python}
#| label: transport-summary
tp = transport.get("summary", {})
tp_params = transport.get("parameters", {})
total_vehicles = tp_params.get("total_vehicles_2026", 131000)
motorcycle_share = tp_params.get("motorcycle_share", 0.92) * 100
```

**Fleet:** `{python} f"{total_vehicles:,}"` registered vehicles, `{python} f"{motorcycle_share:.0f}"`% motorcycles.

**Adoption model:** Logistic S-curve with three scenarios:

```{python}
#| label: tbl-transport-scenarios
#| tbl-cap: "Transport electrification scenarios"

tp_comparison = transport.get("summary", {}).get("comparison", [])
if tp_comparison:
    from IPython.display import Markdown
    md = "| Scenario | EV Share by 2056 | NPV ($M) | BCR | CO₂ Avoided (ktCO₂) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n"
    for item in tp_comparison:
        md += f"| {item['scenario']} | {item['final_ev_share']*100:.0f}% | ${item['npv_net_m']:,.0f}M | {item['bcr']:.2f}× | {item['cumulative_co2_kt']:,.0f} |\n"
    Markdown(md)
```

```{python}
#| label: fig-ev-adoption
#| fig-cap: "EV adoption curves by scenario"

tp_scenarios = transport.get("scenarios", {})
if tp_scenarios:
    fig = go.Figure()
    colors = {"low": "#6c757d", "medium": "#0d6efd", "high": "#198754"}
    for name, data in tp_scenarios.items():
        # data has 'years' (list) and 'ev_share' (list)
        years_ev = data.get("years", [])
        shares = data.get("ev_share", [])
        if years_ev and shares:
            fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
                x=years_ev, y=[s * 100 for s in shares],
                mode="lines", name=name.replace("_", " ").title(),
                line=dict(color=colors.get(name, "#333"), width=2),
            ))
    fig.update_layout(
        title="EV Adoption Rate (% of Fleet)",
        xaxis_title="Year",
        yaxis_title="EV Share (%)",
        height=400,
    )
    fig.show()
```

@fig-ev-adoption illustrates the three logistic S-curve adoption scenarios. The S-curve shape reflects the typical pattern of technology diffusion: slow initial adoption as early adopters take up the technology, rapid acceleration as costs fall and charging infrastructure expands, and eventual saturation as the remaining fleet turns over naturally. The three scenarios bracket a wide range of policy ambition, from minimal intervention (low) to aggressive incentives and infrastructure investment (high).

The transport scenarios table above shows that even the medium adoption scenario generates substantial economic benefits. The positive NPV and BCR above one indicate that transport electrification is economically worthwhile, with benefits larger when EVs are charged from renewable rather than diesel electricity.

Electricity decarbonisation and transport electrification are mutually reinforcing. A decarbonised grid makes EV adoption more environmentally beneficial, while EV adoption increases electricity demand and improves RE asset utilisation.

## C.4 Real Options Analysis {#sec-real-options}

Standard NPV analysis treats each investment decision as a "now-or-never" proposition: the project is either undertaken immediately at today's estimated costs, or it is foregone entirely. Real options theory, as developed by Dixit and Pindyck (1994), recognises that this framing ignores a valuable asset — the ability to **wait and learn** before committing irreversible capital.

### Option Value of Waiting

A submarine cable, once laid, cannot be redeployed to another location or repurposed for another function. The two-and-a-half billion dollars committed to the cable is effectively sunk from the moment construction begins. Meanwhile, the key determinants of the cable's value — battery storage costs, India's electricity export capacity and willingness, bilateral political relations, and the Maldives' own renewable energy performance — are all evolving rapidly and will be far clearer five to ten years from now than they are today.

The cable's marginal BCR versus domestic renewable energy is below one, meaning that the additional investment beyond what a domestic renewable energy pathway would require does not generate commensurate additional benefits at current cost estimates. Each year of delay resolves additional uncertainty: battery costs decline at eighteen percent per capacity doubling (Wright's Law), revealing whether domestic storage can substitute for imported baseload power; India's export policies and grid composition become clearer; and the Maldives' own renewable energy deployment generates performance data that reduces projection uncertainty.

The cost of delay is the foregone cable benefits — approximately one hundred and fifty to two hundred million dollars per year in fuel savings that could have been captured earlier. But these foregone benefits are largely offset by the fuel savings captured through domestic renewable energy deployment, which can proceed in parallel with the cable deferral and which the model shows to be highly cost-effective in its own right.

### Staging Strategy

Rather than a binary invest-or-abandon decision, the real options framework recommends a staged approach that preserves flexibility while capturing immediate value. The first phase (2026–2030) deploys outer-island solar-battery systems, which capture approximately sixty percent of total available fuel savings without any international infrastructure commitment. The second phase (2030–2035) commissions a detailed cable feasibility study while monitoring battery cost trajectories and bilateral diplomatic progress. The critical decision point arrives around 2035, by which time the government will have sufficient information to make a well-informed commitment. If battery costs have fallen faster than expected, domestic renewable energy dominates and the cable is unnecessary. If battery cost declines have stalled or demand growth has exceeded projections, the cable becomes the marginal investment worth pursuing.

### Implications for Scenario Ranking

The real options perspective strengthens the case for S3 (National Grid) and S4 (Islanded Green), both of which preserve maximum future flexibility by avoiding large irreversible commitments to international infrastructure. S2 (Full Integration) requires the largest irreversible commitment earliest and therefore carries the highest opportunity cost of premature commitment. The option value of waiting is estimated at two hundred to five hundred million dollars — three to eight percent of cable CAPEX — depending on assumed cost volatility, a significant sum that standard NPV analysis entirely overlooks.

## C.5 International Benchmarking {#sec-benchmarks}

Comparing this study with published SIDS energy analyses serves two purposes. First, it validates the model's parameter choices and methodological framework against established practice. Second, it identifies where this study advances beyond existing work, contributing to the global evidence base.

This study's parameter values fall comfortably within the published ranges for SIDS energy analyses. The six-percent discount rate follows ADB SIDS practice and is consistent with the central tendency of the studies reviewed. The solar CAPEX of fifteen hundred dollars per kilowatt reflects the installation premium characteristic of island environments — above global utility-scale costs but below the upper end of the range observed in smaller Pacific island installations. The model's LCOE range of nine to thirty-four cents per kilowatt-hour spans the full spectrum from the most cost-effective outer-island solar-battery installations to the most expensive diesel generation on remote islands, consistent with the ranges reported across the benchmarked studies.

This study’s main contribution beyond the existing literature lies in the breadth of its uncertainty treatment and supplementary analyses. The combination of Monte Carlo, tornado diagrams, switching-value analysis, multi-horizon sensitivity, and declining discount rate schedules provides more comprehensive robustness testing than any single published SIDS CBA identified in the literature review. The seven-scenario comparison exceeds the typical two-to-three scenario framework, enabling ranking rather than binary comparison. The island-level least-cost engine with explicit land constraints provides spatial granularity that aggregate national models cannot capture. Distributional analysis using household microdata, multi-criteria scoring, real options framing, endogenous learning curves, and climate damage scenarios each address a dimension that standard CBA overlooks.
