Spread across 900 km of ocean on 1,192 coral islands, the Maldives generates every kilowatt-hour of electricity from imported diesel. Populations range from 50 to 250,000, each island running its own power system.

## The Maldives Energy Story {#sec-energy-story}

```{python}
#| label: current-system
re_share = baseline["re_share"]
diesel_share = baseline["diesel_share"]
installed_mw = baseline["total_capacity_mw"]
diesel_mw = baseline["diesel_capacity_mw"]
solar_mw = baseline["solar_capacity_mw"]
```

The Maldives electricity sector runs almost entirely on imported diesel. As of 2024, roughly `{python} f"{diesel_share*100:.0f}"` per cent of electricity is diesel-generated^[@gom_roadmap2024; confirmed by @reglobal2023 and STELCO operational data.], from a fleet of about `{python} f"{diesel_mw:.0f}"` MW spread across individual powerhouses throughout the archipelago. Installed solar PV capacity stands at only `{python} f"{solar_mw:.0f}"` MW, contributing roughly `{python} f"{re_share*100:.0f}"` per cent of generation. With average global horizontal irradiance of approximately 5.4 kWh/m²/day^[@gsa2023_atlas.], the Maldives is among the best-resourced countries in South Asia for solar energy, making this low deployment striking.

Geographic fragmentation compounds the cost problem. No national grid connects the islands, and no inter-island submarine cables are in operation. Each inhabited island runs its own generation and distribution system, typically consisting of a diesel powerhouse, a low-voltage network, and sometimes a small solar array with limited battery backup. System sizes range from a single 50 kW generator on the smallest atolls to the Greater Malé network with over 140 MW serving a quarter of a million people^[@maldives_iedb2018; STELCO Annual Report.]. In practice, the Maldives faces not one transition challenge but 187 separate ones.

Electricity provision is expensive. Outer-island generation costs fall in the range of $0.30–$0.70 per kWh^[@adb_assure2023; @maldives_srep.], driven by small generator inefficiency and high fuel transport costs. The government subsidises retail tariffs at about $0.15/kWh to maintain affordability^[@gom_roadmap2024; the Roadmap reports over $200 million in annual electricity subsidies.], creating a fiscal burden that grows with demand.

## Why a Transition Is Urgent {#sec-urgency}

```{python}
#| label: urgency-data
bau_fuel = cba["npv_results"]["bau"]["pv_fuel"] / 1e9
bau_emissions = summaries["bau"]["total_emissions_mtco2"]
demand_growth = param("Growth Rate - BAU")
```

The economic case, the environmental imperative, and recent technology cost declines all point toward transition now.

**Economic pressure.** At growth rates of about `{python} f"{demand_growth*100:.0f}"` per cent per year, diesel fuel expenditures would absorb an estimated **`{python} f"${bau_fuel:,.1f}"` billion** in present value over 2026–2056. The 2022 energy price shock illustrated this exposure: generation costs spiked, subsidy bills surged, and the fiscal position deteriorated.

**Climate imperative.** The Maldives is the world’s lowest-lying nation, averaging about 1.5 metres above sea level^[@maldives_ndc2020.]. Under business-as-usual, the electricity sector alone would emit `{python} f"{bau_emissions:,.1f}"` million tonnes of CO₂ over the analysis period. These emissions are small in global terms but difficult to reconcile with the country’s founding membership of AOSIS and its Paris Agreement commitments, including a 26% conditional emissions reduction by 2030^[@maldives_ndc2020.].

**Technology opportunity.** Solar PV costs have fallen by roughly 90% since 2010^[@irena_costs2024.], and lithium-ion battery costs have followed a similar trajectory^[@bnef_battery2025.]. Renewable energy is now cost-competitive with diesel on small, isolated islands without subsidy. The remaining decisions concern which pathway to pursue, how fast to move, and how to finance the upfront capital.

## Alignment with the National Energy Roadmap {#sec-roadmap}

The **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024] targets 33% RE by 2028, identifies 490 MW solar potential, and estimates $1.3B investment across 15 flagship interventions. The seven scenarios in this CBA provide the economic evidence base to assess and prioritise those interventions.

## Purpose of This Analysis {#sec-purpose}

This report applies standard cost-benefit analysis methodology following @adb_guidelines2017 and @boardman2018 to evaluate seven electricity transition pathways for the Maldives.

The framework covers a `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"` -year horizon from `{python} f"{cba['base_year']}"` to `{python} f"{cba['end_year']}"`, using a `{python} f"{cba['discount_rate']*100:.0f}"` per cent real social discount rate (ADB practice for SIDS). Seven scenarios span the technology spectrum from continued diesel through domestic solar-plus-battery, inter-island grids, a submarine cable from India, near-shore and floating solar, wind energy, and LNG. Beyond direct financial costs, the analysis incorporates key externalities: carbon emissions valued at the US EPA Social Cost of Carbon^[@epa_scc2023.], health damages from diesel combustion at $`{python} f"{param('Damage Cost per MWh Diesel'):.0f}"` per MWh following @parry2014, and environmental externalities (noise, fuel spill risk, biodiversity) at $`{python} f"{param('Noise Damage per MWh') + param('Fuel Spill Risk per MWh') + param('Biodiversity Impact per MWh'):.0f}"` per MWh^[Conservative aggregate: noise $`{python} f"{param('Noise Damage per MWh'):.0f}"`/MWh, fuel spill risk $`{python} f"{param('Fuel Spill Risk per MWh'):.0f}"`/MWh, biodiversity $`{python} f"{param('Biodiversity Impact per MWh'):.0f}"`/MWh.].

Robustness testing includes `{python} f"{n_mc_params}"`-parameter Monte Carlo simulation (`{python} f"{monte_carlo['n_iterations']:,}"` iterations with Iman-Conover rank correlations), one-way sensitivity analysis, switching-value analysis, multi-horizon comparison (20, 30, 50 years), and declining discount rate sensitivity following @hm_treasury2022, @weitzman2001, and @drupp2018.

Two extensions complement the CBA. A distributional analysis draws on 4,817 household records from @hies2019 to examine how costs and benefits fall across income quintiles, gender, and geography. A multi-criteria analysis scores scenarios on eight criteria under five weight profiles, covering non-monetisable dimensions such as implementation feasibility and climate resilience.

## Geographic Context {#sec-geography}

```{python}
#| label: fig-geography
#| fig-cap: "The Maldives archipelago spans 900 km north-south across 26 atolls. Each inhabited island operates an independent power system. Greater Malé (inset) concentrates 43% of the population and 57% of electricity demand."

# Detect coordinate and population columns (handle different naming conventions)
lon_col = next((c for c in islands_geo.columns if c in ("Longitude", "X_deg", "lon")), None)

pop_col = next((c for c in islands_geo.columns if c in ("Population_2022", "Pop", "Population")), None)

n_inhabited = len(islands_geo[islands_geo[pop_col] > 0]) if pop_col else 187
total_pop = islands_geo[pop_col].sum() if pop_col else 515000

fig = go.Figure()

if lon_col and lat_col:
    # Build hover text: Island Name (Atoll) — Pop: X,XXX
    name_col = next((c for c in islands_geo.columns if c in ("Island_Name_EN", "Island_Name", "Name")), None)
    hover_text = islands_geo[name_col] if name_col else islands_geo.index.astype(str)
    if pop_col:
        hover_text = hover_text + " — Pop: " + islands_geo[pop_col].apply(lambda x: f"{x:,.0f}")
    
    # Scale marker size by population (log-ish)
    if pop_col:
        marker_size = islands_geo[pop_col].clip(lower=100).apply(lambda x: max(3, min(25, x / 3000)))
    else:
        marker_size = 5
    
    fig.add_trace(go.Scattergeo(
        lon=islands_geo[lon_col],
        lat=islands_geo[lat_col],
        text=hover_text,
        marker=dict(
            size=marker_size,
            color=SCENARIO_COLORS["national_grid"],
            opacity=0.7,
            line=dict(width=0.5, color="white"),
        ),
        hoverinfo="text",
    ))
    
    fig.update_geos(

        projection_scale=25,
        showland=True, landcolor="#f0ebe3",
        showocean=True, oceancolor="#d4e6f1",
        showcoastlines=True, coastlinecolor="#aab7c4",
        showframe=False,
    )
    fig.update_layout(
        height=700,
        title=f"Maldives Archipelago — 26 Atolls, {n_inhabited} Inhabited Islands",
        geo=dict(bgcolor="white"),
        margin=dict(l=0, r=0, t=50, b=0),
    )
else:
    fig.add_annotation(text="Island coordinate data not available for map rendering", 
                       xref="paper", yref="paper", x=0.5, y=0.5, showarrow=False)
    fig.update_layout(height=200)

fig.show()
```

The 26 atolls stretch across nearly 900 km, from Haa Alif in the north to Addu in the south. Many outer islands are separated from their nearest neighbours by 10–50 km of open ocean.

```{python}
#| label: geographic-facts
male_share = baseline["male_electricity_share"]
outer_share = 1 - male_share
male_pop_share = 0.43  # Census 2022: Greater Malé 43% — not in model outputs
```

Electricity demand is concentrated unevenly. Greater Malé — Malé, Hulhumalé, and Villimalé — holds about `{python} f"{male_pop_share*100:.0f}"` per cent of the population^[@maldives_census2022.] and `{python} f"{male_share*100:.0f}"` per cent of electricity demand^[@maldives_iedb2018.], served by STELCO’s power station network (>100 MW installed). The remaining `{python} f"{(1-male_pop_share)*100:.0f}"` per cent of the population, spread across 176 outer islands, accounts for `{python} f"{outer_share*100:.0f}"` per cent of demand but relies on isolated diesel micro-grids that are individually small and expensive to maintain. A separate segment — over 170 privately operated resort islands — consumes an estimated 1,050 GWh/year of diesel-generated electricity^[Derived from resort capacity data and typical load factors; @gom_roadmap2024.] but operates off-grid and outside the scope of this public utility analysis.

This geography determines the structure of every scenario. Solutions for Greater Malé (submarine cables, LNG, near-shore solar) differ fundamentally from outer-island solutions (rooftop and ground-mounted solar with battery storage, deployed island by island). A credible strategy must address both.
