## The Big Picture: All Alternatives Beat Diesel

Every alternative pathway generates net economic benefits compared to continued diesel dependence.

```{python}
#| label: fig-npv-savings
#| fig-cap: "Net present value of savings versus BAU for each alternative scenario. All alternatives generate billions in net benefits."

savings = {s: get_incremental(s)["npv_savings"] / 1e9 for s in ALT_SCENARIOS}
fig = bar_scenario_comparison(
    values=savings,
    title="NPV Savings vs. Diesel BAU ($ Billions)",
    yaxis_title="NPV Savings ($B)",
    highlight_bau=False,
)
fig.update_layout(height=420)
fig.show()
```

```{python}
#| label: headline-numbers
best_sid = max(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: get_incremental(s)["npv_savings"])
worst_sid = min(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: get_incremental(s)["npv_savings"])
best_savings = get_incremental(best_sid)["npv_savings"] / 1e9
worst_savings = get_incremental(worst_sid)["npv_savings"] / 1e9
```

Every alternative saves `{python} f"${worst_savings:,.1f}"` to `{python} f"${best_savings:,.1f}"` billion in present value over `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"` years. `{python} SCENARIO_LABELS[best_sid]` leads; even `{python} SCENARIO_LABELS[worst_sid]` — the least advantageous — delivers substantial benefits. The magnitude reflects cumulative diesel costs over three decades, which outweigh transition capital.

At the base `{python} f"{cba['discount_rate']*100:.0f}"`% discount rate, late-year benefits are heavily discounted. Lower rates (`{python} f"{param('Discount Rate', 'Low')*100:.0f}"`–4%) would increase savings further; at the high end (`{python} f"{param('Discount Rate', 'High')*100:.0f}"`%), all alternatives still dominate diesel — breakeven rates exceed `{python} f"{irr_min:.0f}"`%.

## Cost Breakdown by Component

The cost advantage of renewables becomes clear when lifetime costs are decomposed by component. The stacked chart below separates present-value costs into CAPEX, OPEX, fuel, and PPA imports.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cost-breakdown
#| fig-cap: "Present value of costs by component for each scenario. Fuel costs dominate BAU; CAPEX dominates alternatives but at lower total cost."

components = ["pv_capex", "pv_opex", "pv_fuel", "pv_ppa"]
comp_labels = ["CAPEX", "OPEX", "Fuel", "PPA Imports"]
comp_colors = ["#3498db", "#2ecc71", "#e74c3c", "#9b59b6"]

fig = go.Figure()
for comp, label, color in zip(components, comp_labels, comp_colors):
    vals = [cba["npv_results"][s].get(comp, 0) / 1e9 for s in SCENARIO_IDS]
    fig.add_trace(go.Bar(
        name=label,
        x=[SCENARIO_SHORT[s] for s in SCENARIO_IDS],
        y=vals,
        marker_color=color,
    ))

fig.update_layout(
    barmode="stack",
    title="Present Value of Costs by Component ($B)",
    yaxis_title="PV of Costs ($ Billions)",
    height=480,
    legend=dict(orientation="h", yanchor="bottom", y=1.02, xanchor="right", x=1),
)
fig.show()
```

The cost composition differs sharply between diesel and renewable pathways. Under BAU, fuel dominates at `{python} f"${cba['npv_results']['bau']['pv_fuel']/1e9:,.1f}"` billion — roughly `{python} f"{cba['npv_results']['bau']['pv_fuel']/cba['npv_results']['bau']['pv_total_costs']*100:.0f}"` per cent of total lifetime costs.

Renewable scenarios invert this. Capital expenditure becomes the largest component, while fuel costs shrink or disappear. Total lifetime system cost falls because avoided fuel outweighs additional capital. Once installed, solar and battery systems have near-zero marginal operating cost.

Full Integration (S2) also exhibits significant PPA import costs alongside CAPEX, reflecting ongoing payments for electricity imported through the India cable. These are lower than diesel fuel costs but represent a continuing outflow that domestic renewable scenarios avoid.

### Why Fuel Costs Remain Substantial Even Under Renewable Scenarios {#sec-fuel-persistence}

```{python}
#| label: fuel-persistence-data

# Compute fuel shares and RE shares for all scenarios
_fuel_pcts = {}
_re_finals = {}
_diesel_shares = {}
for _s in SCENARIO_IDS:
    _nr = cba["npv_results"][_s]
    _fuel_pcts[_s] = _nr.get("pv_fuel", 0) / _nr["pv_total_costs"] * 100
    _ss_data = summaries[_s]
    _re_finals[_s] = _ss_data["final_re_share"] * 100
    _diesel_shares[_s] = _ss_data.get("final_diesel_share", 1.0 - _ss_data["final_re_share"]) * 100

_best_re_sid = max(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: _re_finals[s])
_best_re_pct = _re_finals[_best_re_sid]
_worst_re_sid = min(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: _re_finals[s])
_worst_re_pct = _re_finals[_worst_re_sid]
```

Why does fuel still constitute `{python} f"{min(_fuel_pcts[s] for s in ALT_SCENARIOS):.0f}"`–`{python} f"{max(_fuel_pcts[s] for s in ALT_SCENARIOS):.0f}"` per cent of total lifetime costs in the domestic scenarios (S3–S7), even with major renewable investment? The answer: binding physical, geographic, and technical constraints limit achievable RE penetration on small coral islands.

**Land scarcity.** The most fundamental constraint is that the Maldives has only `{python} f"{param('Total Inhabited Island Area'):.0f}"` km² of total inhabited island area, spread across nearly 200 islands. Solar PV requires approximately `{python} f"{param('Area Per kW'):.0f}"` m² per installed kW (including panel spacing and access), and the model caps the usable share of island area at `{python} f"{param('Max Land Fraction')*100:.0f}"` per cent to preserve land for housing, agriculture, vegetation, and public use. On the smallest and most densely populated islands, solar demand for space exceeds this limit, forcing them into diesel-hybrid configurations regardless of economics. Across all inhabited islands, this physical ceiling means that rooftop and ground-mount solar alone cannot supply the growing national demand.

**The Malé bottleneck.** Greater Malé — comprising Malé, Hulhumalé, and Villimalé — consumes more than half of national electricity but is among the most densely built urban areas in the world. With limited available land, rooftop and commercial installations are capped at approximately `{python} f"{param('Male Rooftop Solar Potential'):.0f}"` MWp, which can supply only about `{python} f"{param('Male Max RE Share')*100:.0f}"` per cent of Malé's demand^[ADB Energy Roadmap 2024–2033 (Table 8): 4 MW ASSURE rooftop + 5 MW additional rooftop + 25 MW commercial rooftop on Gulhifalhu/Thilafushi = 34 MWp total. This is nearly double the earlier ZNES Flensburg estimate of 18 MWp (public buildings and sports facilities only).]. Because Malé's demand share is so large, even if every outer island achieved 100 per cent renewable supply, the national weighted average would be constrained by Malé's limited rooftop potential. The Near-Shore Solar (S5) and Maximum RE (S6) scenarios exist specifically to break this bottleneck by siting `{python} f"{param('Near-Shore Solar MW'):.0f}"` MW on uninhabited islands, `{python} f"{param('Floating Solar MW'):.0f}"` MW on floating platforms, and `{python} f"{param('Wind Capacity MW', category='Wind'):.0f}"` MW of wind energy near Malé — which is why S6 achieves the highest final RE share at `{python} f"{_best_re_pct:.0f}"` per cent.

**Deployment speed.** Even where economics and land permit, construction logistics impose a practical ceiling of `{python} f"{param('Deployment Ramp MW per Year'):.0f}"` MW of new solar capacity per year nationally. The ADB Energy Roadmap 2024–2033 identifies a pipeline of 424 MW of planned and potential solar initiatives over five years (approximately 85 MW per year), which the model adopts as the base deployment pace. This reflects the realities of importing equipment to remote atolls, limited port capacity, skilled labour scarcity, and the sequential nature of island-by-island installation. Over the `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"` year analysis period, cumulative installations are substantial, but growing demand (at approximately `{python} f"{param('Growth Rate - BAU')*100:.0f}"` per cent per year) constantly expands the denominator against which the RE share is measured.

Note that the Government of Maldives targets **33 per cent** renewable energy in electricity consumption by 2028 (ADB Energy Roadmap 2024–2033), which requires approximately 800 GWh from renewable sources against projected demand of 2,400 GWh. The model's deployment trajectory is calibrated to this near-term target, and the scenarios explore what happens as the transition continues beyond 2028 toward 2056, with the ultimate RE share determined by the interplay of deployment speed, land constraints, and demand growth.

**Storage duration.** Solar panels produce electricity for roughly six to eight hours per day, concentrated around midday. The model assumes `{python} f"{param('Storage Hours'):.0f}"` hours of battery storage per site, which covers the evening demand peak but cannot carry load through the entire night. With a maximum depth of discharge of `{python} f"{param('Battery DoD Max')*100:.0f}"` per cent and round-trip efficiency of `{python} f"{param('Round-trip Efficiency')*100:.0f}"` per cent, the usable energy per cycle is further reduced. Diesel backup therefore remains essential for overnight and extended cloudy-period generation. Doubling storage duration to eight hours could push RE penetration toward 70–75 per cent on favourable sites, but at current battery prices (`{python} f"${param('CAPEX 2026', category='Battery'):.0f}"`/kWh installed), the additional storage cost exceeds the fuel savings it would displace.

**In aggregate,** even the most ambitious scenario (S6 Maximum RE) reaches only `{python} f"{_best_re_pct:.0f}"` per cent renewable penetration by `{python} f"{cba['end_year']}"`, while S3 and S4 plateau around `{python} f"{_re_finals['national_grid']:.0f}"` to `{python} f"{_re_finals['islanded_green']:.0f}"` per cent. The remaining gap (`{python} f"{_diesel_shares[_best_re_sid]:.0f}"` to `{python} f"{_diesel_shares[_worst_re_sid]:.0f}"` per cent) must be filled by diesel (or LNG in S7), and the cumulative fuel cost of that residual fossil generation over `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"` years produces the large red bars visible in every scenario. This persistent fuel exposure is why the sensitivity analysis (@sec-sensitivity) identifies diesel price as the single most influential parameter: even after transition, the Maldives remains partially dependent on imported fuel. The economic case for transition is strengthened, not weakened, by this reality, because the alternative is *total* dependence under BAU.

The Government of Maldives' Energy Roadmap 2024–2033 [-@gom_roadmap2024] targets 33 per cent renewable energy by 2028. A question of significant policy interest is whether the Maldives can push further — to 70, 80, or even higher renewable energy shares by mid-century. The Maximum RE scenario (S6) provides the analytical framework to answer this question, and the results reveal both encouraging progress and sobering structural limits.

```{python}

```

@fig-re-trajectory shows that **the RE share does not rise monotonically**. Under the Maximum RE scenario, renewable energy reaches approximately `{python} f"{re_2035:.0f}"` per cent by 2035 and peaks around `{python} f"{re_2040:.0f}"` per cent by 2040, temporarily exceeding the 70 per cent threshold, before falling back to `{python} f"{re_2050:.0f}"` per cent by 2050 and `{python} f"{re_2056:.0f}"` per cent by `{python} f"{cba['end_year']}"`. This occurs because renewable energy capacity is bounded by physical constraints (land area, deployment speed, technology availability), while electricity demand continues growing at approximately `{python} f"{growth_rate*100:.0f}"` per cent per year.

### Supply-Side RE Potential

The Maximum RE scenario deploys every available domestic renewable energy technology:

| Technology | Capacity | Annual Generation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rooftop solar (Malé) | `{python} f"{male_rooftop_mw:.0f}"` MWp | ~`{python} f"{male_rooftop_mw * 0.175 * 8.76:.0f}"` GWh | ADB Roadmap Table 8 |
| Near-shore solar | `{python} f"{nearshore_mw:.0f}"` MW | ~`{python} f"{nearshore_mw * 0.175 * 8.76:.0f}"` GWh | Uninhabited islands |
| Floating solar | `{python} f"{floating_mw:.0f}"` MW | ~`{python} f"{floating_mw * 0.175 * 8.76:.0f}"` GWh | GoM Roadmap target |
| Wind energy | `{python} f"{wind_mw:.0f}"` MW | ~`{python} f"{wind_gwh:.0f}"` GWh | ADB Roadmap §4.7.2 |
| Outer island solar | Variable | Growing with demand | Least-cost engine |
| Waste-to-energy | 14 MW | ~98 GWh | Thilafushi facility |

The combined Malé-region RE potential (rooftop + near-shore + floating + wind) is approximately `{python} f"{male_rooftop_mw + nearshore_mw + floating_mw + wind_mw:.0f}"` MW, capable of generating roughly `{python} f"{(male_rooftop_mw + nearshore_mw + floating_mw) * 0.175 * 8.76 + wind_gwh:.0f}"` GWh per year. This is substantial — but it is a *fixed ceiling*, while demand is an exponentially growing quantity.

### The Demand Growth Denominator

At `{python} f"{growth_rate*100:.0f}"` per cent annual growth, national electricity demand roughly doubles every 14 years. By 2050, demand is projected to reach approximately `{python} f"{demand_2050:,.0f}"` GWh — nearly four times the 2026 level. Even if every available renewable technology is deployed at maximum capacity, the fixed RE generation ceiling means that the *share* of renewable energy in total supply inevitably declines once the deployment programme is complete and demand continues growing.

The arithmetic is clear: **renewable capacity is area-constrained; electricity demand is not.** The Maldives cannot manufacture more island area, and floating solar and wind capacity, while helpful, are bounded by lagoon area, environmental constraints, and technical feasibility.

### Pathways to Sustained 70 Per Cent or Higher

Sustaining RE penetration above 70 per cent beyond the 2040 window would require one or more of the following structural changes:

1. **Demand moderation.** If demand growth were moderated to 3.5 per cent per year (the Low sensitivity case) rather than `{python} f"{growth_rate*100:.0f}"` per cent, 2050 demand would be approximately `{python} f"{base_demand * (1.035 ** 24):,.0f}"` GWh rather than `{python} f"{demand_2050:,.0f}"` GWh — a reduction of `{python} f"{(1 - base_demand * 1.035**24 / demand_2050) * 100:.0f}"` per cent that would sustain RE shares above 70 per cent for significantly longer. Energy efficiency standards, time-of-use pricing, and demand-side management programmes are the principal policy levers.

2. **Floating solar expansion beyond 195 MW.** The current target of `{python} f"{floating_mw:.0f}"` MW is aligned with the GoM Roadmap, but the Maldives has approximately 26,000 km² of lagoon area, of which even 0.1 per cent utilisation would yield over 3,000 MW of potential. If floating solar technology matures and costs decline as projected, a second phase of 200–400 MW could substantially extend the RE ceiling. This remains speculative given the technology's immaturity in tropical marine environments.

3. **Wind energy expansion.** The ADB Roadmap identifies `{python} f"{wind_mw:.0f}"` MW of wind potential, contributing approximately `{python} f"{wind_gwh:.0f}"` GWh per year (roughly 4–5 percentage points of RE share). Scaling wind beyond `{python} f"{wind_mw:.0f}"` MW is constrained by the Maldives' relatively modest wind resources — capacity factors of `{python} f"{wind_cf*100:.0f}"` per cent are below the global average for onshore wind — but it provides valuable generation diversity (wind and solar have partially complementary diurnal profiles).

4. **India submarine cable.** The Full Integration scenario (S2) achieves the highest *total* clean energy supply by importing grid electricity from India, but this reduces *domestic* RE share to approximately `{python} f"{summaries['full_integration']['final_re_share']*100:.0f}"` per cent. Whether imported electricity counts toward RE targets depends on the carbon intensity of the Indian grid, which is currently `{python} f"{param('India Grid Emission Factor'):.2f}"` kgCO₂/kWh and declining.

::: {.callout-important}
## 70% RE is achievable but time-limited
The Maximum RE scenario demonstrates that 70 per cent renewable energy penetration is technically feasible and economically attractive in the late 2030s window. However, sustaining this level requires either moderating demand growth, expanding floating solar beyond current plans, or accepting that the Maldives' domestic RE share will plateau in the 60–65 per cent range by 2050 under base-case demand growth.

## Benefit-Cost Ratios and Returns

BCR >1 means net value creation; IRR above the `{python} f"{cba['discount_rate']*100:.0f}"`% hurdle confirms viability.

```{python}

```

All six alternatives achieve BCRs well above 1.0 and IRRs above the `{python} f"{cba['discount_rate']*100:.0f}"`% hurdle (dashed red line). Highest BCRs go to scenarios with deepest diesel displacement. LNG (S7) achieves the highest IRR — modest CAPEX plus rapid fuel savings — though not the highest absolute NPV.

The full results table below consolidates all key metrics for ready comparison across scenarios.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-results-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Full scenario comparison table: costs, savings, returns, emissions."

tbl = make_summary_table()
tbl_fmt = tbl.copy()
tbl_fmt["PV Total Costs ($B)"] = tbl_fmt["PV Total Costs ($B)"].apply(lambda x: f"${x:,.1f}")
tbl_fmt["LCOE ($/kWh)"] = tbl_fmt["LCOE ($/kWh)"].apply(lambda x: f"${x:.3f}")
tbl_fmt["NPV Savings ($B)"] = tbl_fmt["NPV Savings ($B)"].apply(lambda x: f"${x:,.1f}" if x > 0 else "—")

tbl_fmt["IRR (%)"] = tbl_fmt["IRR (%)"].apply(lambda x: f"{x:.1f}%" if isinstance(x, (int, float)) and x > 0 else "—")
tbl_fmt["Emissions (MtCO₂)"] = tbl_fmt["Emissions (MtCO₂)"].apply(lambda x: f"{x:.1f}")
tbl_fmt["Final RE (%)"] = tbl_fmt["Final RE (%)"].apply(lambda x: f"{x:.0f}%")

from IPython.display import Markdown
Markdown(tbl_fmt.to_markdown(index=False))
```

Every alternative beats diesel. Highest RE shares deliver largest NPV, lowest LCOE, deepest emissions cuts — but may involve more capital and tech risk (floating solar in S6). LNG stands out for fast payback: it swaps fuels rather than transforming the technology base.

Diesel BAU LCOE exceeds global mini-grid averages — fuel transport, scale inefficiencies, remote maintenance. Renewable scenarios approach SIDS averages and, in some cases, near global utility-scale solar — remarkable for a small island nation. The gap represents the per-unit cost advantage that compounds into billions in NPV savings.

## Emissions Trajectories

The Maldives has Paris Agreement commitments and, as the lowest-lying nation, an existential stake in climate action.

```{python}
#| label: fig-emissions
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative CO₂ emissions by scenario. All alternatives achieve significant emission reductions versus diesel BAU."

emissions = {s: summaries[s]["total_emissions_mtco2"] for s in SCENARIO_IDS}

fig = bar_scenario_comparison(
    values=emissions,
    title="Cumulative CO₂ Emissions, 2026–2056 (MtCO₂)",
    yaxis_title="MtCO₂",
    highlight_bau=True,
)
fig.show()
```

```{python}
#| label: emission-reductions
bau_em = summaries["bau"]["total_emissions_mtco2"]
best_em_sid = min(ALT_SCENARIOS, key=lambda s: summaries[s]["total_emissions_mtco2"])
best_em = summaries[best_em_sid]["total_emissions_mtco2"]
reduction_pct = (1 - best_em / bau_em) * 100
```

Under diesel BAU, the electricity sector would emit `{python} f"{bau_em:,.1f}"` million tonnes of CO₂ over `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"` years. The cleanest scenario, `{python} SCENARIO_SHORT[best_em_sid]`, cuts cumulative emissions by `{python} f"{reduction_pct:.0f}"` per cent to `{python} f"{best_em:,.1f}"` million tonnes. Even S7 (LNG), which retains fossil fuel, achieves a `{python} f"{(1 - param('LNG Emission Factor') / 0.72)*100:.0f}"` per cent reduction in emission intensity by switching from diesel to gas.

The emissions ranking does not perfectly mirror the economic ranking. Some slightly less cost-optimal scenarios deliver substantially deeper decarbonisation, but the trade-off is modest: the cost difference between the most efficient and the most ambitious scenario is small relative to the savings both deliver versus diesel.

## The India Cable vs. Domestic Alternatives

The cable beats diesel, but the more informative comparison is whether it beats the next-best domestic option.

```{python}
#| label: fi-vs-ng
fi_vs_ng = cba["incremental_fi_vs_ng"]
```

The incremental analysis reveals that the India cable requires `{python} fmt_usd(fi_vs_ng['additional_capex'])` in additional capital expenditure beyond what the National Grid domestic scenario would cost. This additional investment yields an incremental benefit-cost ratio of only `{python} f"{fi_vs_ng['bcr']:.2f}"`, which falls below the 1.0 threshold — meaning that the marginal costs of the cable exceed its marginal benefits relative to domestic solar-plus-battery. The incremental IRR of `{python} f"{fi_vs_ng['irr']*100:.1f}"` per cent is below the `{python} f"{cba['discount_rate']*100:.0f}"` per cent social discount rate, and the incremental payback period extends to `{python} fi_vs_ng['payback_years']` years, raising questions about the cable's economic justification on the margin.

::: {.callout-important}
## The cable does not pay for itself on the margin
While S2 saves money versus *diesel* (BCR `{python} f"{get_incremental('full_integration')['bcr']:.1f}"` ×), it does *not* save money versus *domestic solar+battery* (S3). The cable's marginal BCR of `{python} f"{fi_vs_ng['bcr']:.2f}"` means that every additional dollar invested in the cable yields only `{python} f"{fi_vs_ng['bcr']*100:.0f}"` cents of additional benefit. Domestic RE is more cost-effective.
:::

Geopolitical or strategic considerations could override the economic analysis, but the cost-effectiveness evidence points clearly toward domestic alternatives. The same capital yields more benefit if invested in solar, battery, and near-shore capacity. The cable’s marginal economics would improve under 50 per cent cost-sharing with India, lower export prices, or domestic solar cost escalation. These conditions are plausible but speculative, which reinforces the real-options argument for deferring the cable decision (@sec-real-options).
