About `{python} f"{baseline['diesel_share']*100:.0f}"`% of the Maldives' electricity comes from imported diesel^[Government of Maldives, *Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033* [-@gom_roadmap2024]; confirmed by @reglobal2023 and @irena_roadmap_maldives2015.], exposing the country to fuel price volatility and generation costs at odds with its climate commitments. This report presents a **cost-benefit analysis (CBA)** of seven alternative electricity transition pathways over `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"` years (`{python} f"{cba['base_year']}"` – `{python} f"{cba['end_year']}"`  ).

The analysis builds on the Government of Maldives' **Road Map for the Energy Sector 2024–2033** [-@gom_roadmap2024], which targets 33% renewable energy by 2028 and identifies 490 MW of solar potential across 15 interventions ($1.3 billion estimated investment). The seven scenarios examined here provide the economic evidence base for prioritising among those interventions.

### What this report offers policymakers {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
All six alternative pathways yield present-value savings of **`{python} f"${savings_min_b:,.1f} billion to ${savings_max_b:,.1f} billion"`** compared with continued diesel dependence.
:::

- **Seven scenarios** — from an India submarine cable to islanded solar+battery systems, compared on a common framework
- **Open, reproducible methods** — parameter sources documented; code available
- **Policy-oriented outputs** — financing structures and distributional equity, with multi-criteria ranking to support decision-making
- **Uncertainty analysis** — `{python} f"{n_mc_params}"`-parameter Monte Carlo, tornado diagrams, switching-value analysis
