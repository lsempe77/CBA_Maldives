# Implementation Roadmap {#sec-implementation}

::: {.chapter-opening}
No single scenario should be adopted wholesale. The recommended approach borrows from several: deploy irreversible, high-certainty investments immediately (outer-island solar-battery, S4) and near-shore solar for Greater Malé (S5), while deferring the large, lumpy commitments (LNG terminal, India cable) until uncertainty has narrowed.

## Phased Strategy

The strategy synthesises elements from multiple pathways to capture early fuel savings while preserving flexibility on larger commitments. Phasing reflects the Maldives’ absorptive capacity, constrained by construction-sector throughput, port logistics, and institutional bandwidth.

phasing = cba.get("investment_phasing_musd", {})

if phasing:
    # Use national_grid as the representative 'recommended' pathway;
    # fall back to first available non-BAU scenario
    recommended = phasing.get("national_grid", phasing.get("islanded_green", {}))
    if not recommended:
        recommended = next((v for k, v in phasing.items() if k != "bau"), {})

@fig-roadmap shows investment phasing by technology. Front-loading solar/battery captures immediate fuel savings and builds institutional experience; larger, uncertain investments (cable) are deferred for better information.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (2026–2028)

Solar-battery deployment on ~170 outer islands where LCOE is roughly half that of diesel. The target is `{python} f"{param('Deployment Ramp MW per Year'):.0f}"` MW/yr, starting with islands where the cost advantage is largest.

In parallel: initiate EIAs for near-shore solar sites (Thilafushi, Gulhifalhu; 18–24 months typical)^[EPA guidelines.] and commission LNG terminal feasibility studies. These planning activities create option value for later phases.

## Phase 2: Scale-Up (2029–2032)

Focus shifts to Greater Malé. ~`{python} f"{param('Near-Shore Solar MW'):.0f}"` MW of near-shore solar farms on uninhabited islands near the capital serve the population centre (~50% of demand).

If feasibility studies support it: `{python} f"{param('LNG Plant Capacity MW'):.0f}"` MW LNG at Gulhifalhu as a bridge fuel. This implies a `{python} f"{cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}"`-year fuel lock-in — proceed only if RE alone cannot meet baseload with acceptable reliability.

Remaining outer-island solar-battery completes during this phase. Monitoring of India cable technology continues, preserving the option for Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Optimisation (2033–2040)

If floating solar has matured sufficiently: up to `{python} f"{param('Floating Solar MW'):.0f}"` MW floating solar + `{python} f"{param('Wind Capacity MW', category='Wind'):.0f}"` MW wind, dramatically expanding RE beyond land-constrained islands.

Critical India cable go/no-go ~2035. By then: decade of RE operational experience, updated cable cost projections, clearer geopolitical signals. The real options analysis (@sec-real-options) shows that waiting value exceeds deferral cost.

Battery replacement for Phase 1 systems (`{python} f"{param('Lifetime', category='Battery'):.0f}"`-year lifetime^[@bnef_battery2025.]) commences 2041–43. Plan from 2033; anticipate `{python} f"{param('Learning Rate', category='Battery')*100:.0f}"`%/doubling cost reductions (Wright's Law)^[@irena_costs2024.]. Target full cost recovery by 2040 with targeted social protection (@sec-distributional).

## Phase 4: Maturation (2041–2056)

Maintenance, replacement cycles, adaptive management. Solar degradation (~`{python} f"{param('Degradation Rate', category='Solar')*100:.1f}"`%/yr^[@jordan2013.]) means 7–15% capacity loss by this period; replacement decisions depend on prevailing costs.

Demand-side management (smart grid, ToU pricing, efficiency standards) moderates growth and aligns consumption with solar profiles. If demand exceeds projections, deploy additional capacity or second cable/LNG as warranted.

## Key Decision Points

The roadmap centres on discrete decision points, deferring irreversible commitments until evidence is sufficient.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-decision-points
#| tbl-cap: "Critical decision points and their dependencies."

decisions = pd.DataFrame([
    {"Year": 2026, "Decision": "Solar deployment ramp rate", "Key Dependency": "ADB/MDB financing commitment", "Reversibility": "Low cost to adjust"},
    {"Year": 2027, "Decision": "Near-shore solar site selection", "Key Dependency": "EIA completion; land tenure", "Reversibility": "Moderate — site-specific"},
    {"Year": 2028, "Decision": "LNG terminal commitment", "Key Dependency": "Gulhifalhu infrastructure readiness", "Reversibility": f"High — {cba['end_year'] - cba['base_year']}yr fuel lock-in"},
    {"Year": 2030, "Decision": "India cable feasibility study", "Key Dependency": "Bilateral agreement status", "Reversibility": "Low — study only"},
    {"Year": 2032, "Decision": "Floating solar pilot", "Key Dependency": "Technology maturity; marine permits", "Reversibility": "Moderate"},
    {"Year": 2031, "Decision": "Wind energy deployment", "Key Dependency": "ADB Roadmap site studies; turbine procurement", "Reversibility": "Moderate — phased over 3 years"},
    {"Year": 2035, "Decision": "India cable go/no-go", "Key Dependency": "Cable cost trends; domestic RE performance; geopolitics", "Reversibility": f"Very high — ${get_summary('full_integration')['total_capex_million']/1000:.1f}B+ commitment"},
])

@tbl-decision-points shows progressive escalation of commitment. Early decisions (2026 solar ramp) are highly adjustable; later decisions (2028 LNG, 2035 cable) are effectively irreversible. The reversibility column is a heuristic: low = proceed and adapt; very high = defer until evidence is strong.

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Solar/wind/battery cost increase | Low | Moderate | Locked-in via PPA; learning curves favour decline |
| Diesel price spike | Medium | High | Accelerates transition ROI; increases BAU costs |
| India cable outage | Medium (λ=`{python} f"{param('Outage Rate'):.2f}"`/yr)^a^ | Very high | Maintain 20% diesel backup; diversified supply |
| Floating solar technology failure | Medium | Moderate | Defer commitment; pilot first; fallback to conventional |
| Climate damage to infrastructure | Medium | High | `{python} f"{param('Adaptation CAPEX Premium')*100:.1f}"`% adaptation premium in CAPEX^b^; resilient design |
| Financing unavailability | Low | Very high | Multiple MDB pipelines; grant element `{python} f"{financing[ALT_SCENARIOS[0]].get('grant_element_pct', 82.8):.1f}"`% with ADB SIDS terms^c^ |
| Subsidy reform political resistance | High | Moderate | Gradual phase-out 2030–2040; targeted protection for low-income |

^a^ Based on NorNed and Basslink operational records; see @sec-s2. ^b^ @gca2025; 5–15% range. ^c^ @adb_lending2026.

The risks with the largest potential consequences (financing shortfall, cable outage) are also the least likely. The most probable risk (political resistance to subsidy reform) has manageable impact. A diesel price spike would actually *strengthen* the transition case. Climate damage warrants particular attention given the Maldives’ extreme physical vulnerability; distributed RE pathways (S4–S6) are inherently more resilient to localised damage than centralised alternatives.
